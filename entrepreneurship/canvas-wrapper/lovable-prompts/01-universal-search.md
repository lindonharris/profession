# Canvas Wiz - Page 1: Universal Search

## Problem Statement

Canvas Wiz solves the Canvas navigation crisis where students spend 10+ minutes hunting for assignments hidden in random locations. This search page indexes every piece of content across all Canvas courses, making everything instantly findable.

## Lovable Prompt

Create a search interface that lets students search across ALL their Canvas course content from one place. Students waste time hunting for assignments because Canvas lacks search functionality and instructors hide content in random places. This tool should index everything - assignments, files, discussions, announcements, grades - making it all instantly searchable.

### Design Aesthetic

Think Bloomberg Terminal meets Notion. Sharp corners, not rounded. Precise grid layouts with intentional left/right justification creating visual rhythm. Generous whitespace but compact information density where it matters. Typography should be crisp and hierarchical - use weight and size, not color, for primary emphasis.

### Core Experience

A prominent search bar that returns instant results showing WHAT was found and WHERE it lives in Canvas's maze (full breadcrumb path). Results should feel like a precise data table, not cards. Each row is scannable, with left-aligned titles and right-aligned metadata (due dates, points, status) creating clean columns.

The interface should feel like a professional tool - fast, precise, no-nonsense. Every pixel has purpose.
