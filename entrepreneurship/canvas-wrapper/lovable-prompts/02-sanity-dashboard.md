# Canvas Wiz - Page 2: Sanity Dashboard

## Problem Statement

Canvas Wiz provides the homepage Canvas should have built - a single view of everything that matters across all courses. No more checking five different places to know what's due or discovering hidden assignments after deadlines.

## Lovable Prompt

Create a dashboard that aggregates all assignments, deadlines, and updates into one authoritative view, regardless of where instructors hid them. Canvas lets instructors hide critical navigation, causing students to miss assignments. This dashboard surfaces everything.

### Design Aesthetic

Dense information display that breathes. Think financial dashboard or flight control system - rectangular zones with sharp edges, clear boundaries. Use justified text blocks and tabular data. Left-align labels, right-align values. Create visual rhythm through consistent spacing, not decoration.

### Core Experience

Structured zones for "Due Today," "This Week," and "All Assignments." Each zone is a precise table or list, not cards. Include location indicators showing where items are hidden. Status indicators should be minimal - perhaps just a vertical color bar on the left edge, not badges or pills.

The page should feel like a mission control center - authoritative, calm, everything visible at once. Zero ambiguity, zero anxiety, just clear information hierarchy and immediate access to what matters.
