**Date Accessed:** October 5, 2025
**Source Type:** Job search platform

**Key Findings:**

**For 5-50 Employee Agencies:**
- **Title:** Operations Manager (not "Accountant")
- **Why:** Small agencies don't have dedicated accounting department
- **AR Ownership:** Operations Manager owns billing + collections

- Large purchases: May require CEO sign-off (our $12K likely needs approval)

**Analysis:**
- ✅ Operations Manager owns AR at this size (5-50 employees)
- ⚠️ Budget authority exists but $12K may need CEO approval
- ✅ Direct report to CEO (short decision chain)

**Implications:**

- **Secondary buyer:** CEO/Owner (approves $12K expenditure)
- **Sales approach:** Demo with Ops Manager, CEO optional but recommended

## Validation Against Research Findings

### Pain Validation (from phase1-pain-validation.md)
✅ **Aligned:** Operations Manager owns AR pain (Reddit threads confirm)
- "At what point do you start to panic over a past due invoice?" (Source 3)
- → Operations Manager experiences this panic directly

### Market Sizing (from phase1-market-sizing.md)
✅ **Aligned:** 9,000-12,000 agencies = 9,000-12,000 potential buyers
- → Each agency has 1 Operations Manager (primary buyer)

### Competitive Pricing (from phase1-competitive-pricing.md)
✅ **Aligned:** Operations Manager has budget to hire $2,500/month VA
- → Can afford our $12K + $2K/month (with CEO approval)

### Self-Service Feasibility (from phase1-self-service-feasibility.md)
✅ **Aligned:** Operations Manager is tech-savvy (uses QuickBooks, project management tools)
- → Can complete 2-hour setup wizard without hand-holding

---

## Research Limitations

**1. Job Posting Bias:**
- Only analyzed public job postings (agencies hiring may differ from agencies not hiring)
- Job descriptions may be idealized (not actual day-to-day reality)
- Need to interview actual Operations Managers to validate

**2. LinkedIn Profile Sampling:**
- Only reviewed 10-15 profiles (small sample)
- Self-reported skills (may overstate proficiency)
- Profiles may be outdated (need current data)

**3. No Direct Interviews:**
- All data is secondary (job postings, profiles, surveys)
- Haven't validated pain points directly with persona
- Phase 2 should include 5-10 customer development interviews

**4. Budget Authority Estimates:**
- Based on general business norms, not agency-specific data
- $12K threshold is assumption (may be higher/lower)
- Need to test with real purchase data

---
