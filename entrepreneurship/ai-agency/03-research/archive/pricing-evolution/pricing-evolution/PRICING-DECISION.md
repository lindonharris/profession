# Pricing Decision: $100/month (Final)

**Decision Date:** October 5, 2025
**Decision:** Maintain $100/month per agent pricing
**Rationale:** Willing to accept narrower TAM given minuscule overhead

---

## Final Pricing

**$100/month per agent (no setup fee)**

---

## Decision Rationale

### Why $100/month Works for This Business Model

**1. Minuscule Overhead = High Margin Flexibility**
- Fixed costs: ~$97/month (Vercel, Supabase, n8n, domain)
- Variable costs: ~$5-10/agent/month (n8n operations, GPT-4 API)
- **Gross margin: 90-95% even at $100/month**
- Can afford lower customer count vs. needing volume at $50/month

**2. Premium Positioning = Better Customer Quality**
- $100/month filters for serious, established freelancers/agencies
- Higher price = lower churn (customers who pay more value it more)
- Quality over quantity (100 customers at $100 > 200 at $50)

**3. Defensible Against Zapier at 2x Premium**
- Zapier Pro: $50/month + 10 hours building = $550 effective cost
- buyanagent.ai: $100/month + 30 min setup = $125 effective cost
- **$425 savings = strong value proposition**

**4. Room for Future Discount Strategy**
- Launch at $100/month
- Can discount to $70-80/month if needed (still profitable)
- Cannot easily RAISE price from $50 to $100 later

## Objection Handling (Updated for $100)

### "That's 2x more expensive than Zapier"

**Response:**
"Zapier Professional is $50/month, but you'll spend 10 hours building and debugging workflows. If your time is worth $100/hour, that's $1,000 in labor.

**Math:**
- Zapier: $50 + (10 hours Ã— $100/hour) = $1,050
- Us: $100 + (0.5 hours Ã— $100/hour) = $150

**You save $900 in Month 1**, plus ongoing maintenance time every month."

---

### "I'm a solo freelancer, $100/month feels expensive"

**Response:**
"Let's calculate ROI on one agent - Expense Tracker:

**Manual expense tracking:** 2 hours/week Ã— 4 weeks = 8 hours/month
**Your rate:** $100/hour (conservative for established freelancer)
**Time cost:** 8 hours Ã— $100 = **$800/month**

**Our agent:** $100/month
**Net savings:** $700/month

Even at $50/hour, you save $300/month. The agent pays for itself 3-8x over.

Plus, you can start with just 1 agent ($100/month) and add more as you see the value."

---

### "What if I activate 5 agents? That's $500/month!"

**Response:**
"If you activate 5 agents at $100 each ($500/month), you're replacing 50 hours of manual work per month.

At $100/hour, that's **$5,000 in time value**.

**ROI: 10:1** ($5,000 saved, $500 paid)

Plus, we offer bundle discounts:
- 3 agents: $270/month (10% off) instead of $300
- 5 agents: $450/month (10% off) instead of $500

And remember: Zapier Team at $300/month has task limits. Our agents run unlimited with no task anxiety or surprise overage fees."
