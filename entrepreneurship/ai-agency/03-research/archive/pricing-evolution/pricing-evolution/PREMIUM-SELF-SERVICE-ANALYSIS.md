## The Self-Service Premium Threshold

### Research Findings:

**$0-100/month:**
- ✅ Pure self-service works easily
- ✅ Credit card purchase, no approval needed
- ✅ Impulse buy territory

**$100-300/month:**
- ✅ Self-service works IF value is obvious
- ⚠️ Requires ROI calculator or clear value prop
- ⚠️ Expect 24-48 hour decision time (not impulse)

**$300-500/month:**
- ⚠️ Self-service works BUT needs exceptional quality
- ⚠️ Users will compare to alternatives heavily
- ⚠️ Churn risk higher if value not immediately obvious
- ✅ Still no sales calls needed if onboarding is perfect

**$500-1,000/month:**
- ⚠️ Self-service POSSIBLE but harder
- ⚠️ Often requires consultation/demo (not pure self-service)
- ⚠️ Annual billing helps ($500/month = $5K/year upfront commitment)

**$1,000+/month:**
- ❌ Rarely self-service (requires sales team)
- ❌ Needs trust-building (case studies, references, demos)

## Objection Handling at $300/month

### "That's 3x more expensive than Zapier"

**Response:**
"Zapier Professional is $100/month, but you'll spend 10 hours building and debugging workflows. If your time is worth $150/hour, that's $1,500 in labor.

**Math:**
- Zapier: $100 + (10 hours × $150/hour) = $1,600
- Us: $300 + (0.5 hours × $150/hour) = $375

**You save $1,225 in Month 1**, plus ongoing maintenance time every month.

Plus, we include white-glove onboarding and priority support. Zapier charges $2K+ for their implementation services."

---

### "I'm a solo freelancer, $300/month feels expensive"

**Response:**
"Let's calculate ROI on one agent - Expense Tracker:

**Manual expense tracking:** 2 hours/week × 4 weeks = 8 hours/month
**Your rate:** $150/hour (conservative for established freelancer)
**Time cost:** 8 hours × $150 = **$1,200/month**

**Our agent:** $300/month
**Net savings:** $900/month

Even at $100/hour, you save $500/month. The agent pays for itself 2-4x over.

Plus, you can start with just 1 agent ($300/month) and add more as you see the value."

---

### "What if I activate 5 agents? That's $1,500/month!"

**Response:**
"If you activate 5 agents at $300 each ($1,500/month), you're replacing 50 hours of manual work per month.

At $150/hour, that's **$7,500 in time value**.

**ROI: 5:1** ($7,500 saved, $1,500 paid)

Plus, we offer bundle discounts:
- 3 agents: $810/month (10% off) instead of $900
- 5 agents: $1,350/month (10% off) instead of $1,500

And remember: Zapier Team at $600/month has task limits. Our agents run unlimited with no task anxiety or surprise overage fees."
