# Tiered Pricing Strategy: Trojan Horse Approach

**Date:** October 5, 2025
**Strategy:** Launch at $100/month (self-service MVP) ‚Üí Introduce premium tier later
**Goal:** Validate market at accessible price, then capture premium segment

---

## The Two-Tier Strategy

### Tier 1: Self-Service ($100/month) - MVP LAUNCH
**Purpose:** Market validation & customer acquisition
**Target:** 250-500 customers
**Launch:** Month 1 (MVP)

### Tier 2: White-Glove ($500/month) - PHASE 2
**Purpose:** Premium boutique positioning
**Target:** 50-100 customers
**Launch:** Month 6-12 (after validation)

---

## Why $500 (Not $350) for White-Glove Tier

### Time Investment Analysis:

**White-Glove Service Includes:**
1. **30-minute onboarding call** = 0.5 hours
2. **Custom agent tweaks** = 1-2 hours (per agent)
3. **Monthly check-in calls** = 0.25 hours/month
4. **Priority support** (4-hour response) = 2-4 hours/month (average)
5. **Total time investment:** 4-7 hours/month per customer

**Your Time Value:**
- Conservative: $150/hour √ó 5 hours = $750/month
- Moderate: $200/hour √ó 5 hours = $1,000/month

**Margin Analysis:**

| Price | Your Time Cost | Net Margin | Viable? |
|-------|----------------|------------|---------|
| **$350** | $750/month (5 hrs √ó $150) | -$400/month | ‚ùå LOSING MONEY |
| **$500** | $750/month (5 hrs √ó $150) | -$250/month | ‚ùå STILL LOSING |
| **$500** | $500/month (2.5 hrs √ó $200) | $0/month | ‚ö†Ô∏è BREAK-EVEN |

**Wait, this doesn't work...**

## The Problem: Per-Agent Pricing Doesn't Support White-Glove

### The Math Problem:

If pricing is **per agent**, white-glove service doesn't scale:

**Customer activates 1 agent at $500:**
- Revenue: $500/month
- Your time: 5 hours
- Time cost: $750
- **Net: -$250/month (LOSING MONEY)**

**Customer activates 3 agents at $500 each:**
- Revenue: $1,500/month
- Your time: Still ~5 hours (onboarding once, tweaks for 3 agents)
- Time cost: $750
- **Net: +$750/month (PROFITABLE)**

**Insight:** White-glove only works if customers activate MULTIPLE agents.

---

## Solution 1: White-Glove as PER-CUSTOMER Pricing (Not Per-Agent)

### Recommended Structure:

**Tier 1: Self-Service - $100/month per agent**
- Self-activation (30-minute setup guide)
- Email support (24-hour response)
- Documentation & video tutorials
- Pre-built agents as-is
- No customization

**Tier 2: White-Glove - $999/month per customer (up to 5 agents)**
- Includes up to 5 agents (customer chooses which ones)
- 30-minute personal onboarding call
- Custom agent tweaks (2 hours/month of dev time)
- Monthly 15-minute check-in calls
- Priority support (4-hour response)
- Dedicated Slack channel (optional)

**Pricing Logic:**
- $999/month for 5 agents = $199.80/agent effective price
- Cheaper per-agent than self-service ($100) BUT requires commitment
- Customer must activate 3+ agents to get value ($999 for 3 agents = $333/agent)

**Unit Economics:**
- Revenue: $999/month
- Your time: 5-7 hours/month √ó $150/hour = $750-1,050
- Net margin: -$51 to +$249/month

**Problem:** Still barely profitable or losing money!

## Solution 2: White-Glove as Premium Per-Agent with Minimum

### Recommended Structure:

**Tier 1: Self-Service - $100/month per agent**
- Self-activation
- Email support (24-hour response)
- Pre-built agents as-is

**Tier 2: White-Glove - $500/month per agent (3-agent minimum)**
- Minimum commitment: 3 agents = $1,500/month
- Personal onboarding call (one-time, 30 min)
- Custom agent tweaks included
- Monthly check-in calls
- Priority support (4-hour response)
- Early access to new agents

**Pricing Logic:**
- Forces $1,500/month minimum spend
- Your time: 5 hours/month √ó $200 = $1,000
- **Net margin: $500/month per customer (33% margin)**

**This works!**

---

## Solution 3: Hybrid Approach (RECOMMENDED)

### Two-Tier with Smart Bundling:

**Tier 1: Self-Service**
- **$100/month per agent**
- Self-activation (30-minute guide)
- Email support (24-hour response)
- Pre-built agents as-is
- Target: 250-500 customers

**Tier 2: Premium**
- **$300/month per agent** (no minimum)
- White-glove onboarding call (30 min)
- Custom agent tweaks (up to 1 hour/agent)
- Priority support (4-hour response)
- Monthly check-in calls (15 min/month)
- Target: 50-100 customers

**Why $300 (not $500) for Premium?**

**Time Investment (Optimized):**
- Onboarding call: 30 min (one-time, not recurring)
- Custom tweaks: 1 hour/agent (one-time)
- Monthly check-in: 15 min/month (0.25 hrs)
- Priority support: 1 hour/month average (not 4 hours)
- **Total: 1.5 hours one-time + 1.25 hours/month ongoing**

**First Month:**
- Revenue: $300
- Your time: 2.75 hours √ó $150 = $412
- Net: -$112 (investment month)

**Months 2+:**
- Revenue: $300/month
- Your time: 1.25 hours √ó $150 = $187
- **Net: +$113/month (38% margin)**

**If customer activates 3 agents (typical):**
- Revenue: $900/month
- Your time: 1.5 hrs onboarding + 3.75 hrs/month = 5.25 hrs
- Time cost: 5.25 √ó $150 = $787
- **Net: +$113/month after Month 1**

**This works and scales!**

## Why This Tiering Works

### 1. **MVP Risk Mitigation**

- Validate demand before investing in white-glove infrastructure
- If $100 fails, you learned without building premium tier

### 2. **Natural Upgrade Path**

- Loves it, activates 2nd agent at $100
- Realizes they want customization ‚Üí upgrades to Premium
- Now paying $300/agent √ó 3 agents = $900/month

### 3. **Time Investment Scales**
- Self-Service: 0 hours/customer (automated)
- Premium: 1.5 hrs onboarding + 1.25 hrs/month per customer
- 100 Premium customers = 125 hours/month = 30 hours/week (manageable)

### 4. **Revenue Diversification**
- Self-Service: High volume, low touch, predictable
- Premium: Lower volume, high touch, high margin
- **Combined:** $50K (self-service) + $90K (premium) = $140K MRR = $1.68M ARR

### 5. **Competitive Positioning**

| Competitor | Self-Service | Premium |
|------------|--------------|---------|
| **Zapier** | $100/month (Team) | $600/month (no white-glove) |
| **Make** | $9/month | $299/month (no white-glove) |
