# Pricing Philosophy: Boutique vs. Scale

**Date:** October 5, 2025
**Context:** Founder clarification - "I don't want mass-market. A handful of users who LOVE it is sufficient."

---

## The Question

**Should we push price HIGHER than $100/month given:**
1. Not seeking mass-market scale
2. Want a handful of users who LOVE the product
3. Minuscule overhead = don't need many customers
4. Less competitive pressure (quality over quantity)

---

## Pricing Options Analysis

### Option A: Stay at $100/month
**Target:** 250-500 customers
**ARR Goal:** $600K-1.2M
**Positioning:** Premium but accessible

**Pros:**
- Easier customer acquisition (lower barrier)
- Proven price point (Adobe, QuickBooks range)
- 2x Zapier = defensible

**Cons:**
- Still need hundreds of customers
- More competitive at this price point
- Less exclusive/boutique feel

---

### Option B: Raise to $200-300/month ← **RECOMMENDED**
**Target:** 50-100 customers
**ARR Goal:** $600K-1.2M (same revenue, fewer customers)
**Positioning:** Boutique premium service

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Handful of customers** (50-100 vs 250-500)
- ✅ **Higher quality bar** - only serve customers who truly value it
- ✅ **Less support burden** - 100 customers vs 500 customers
- ✅ **More personal relationships** - can know each customer by name
- ✅ **Pricing power** - can justify with white-glove support
- ✅ **Less churn anxiety** - losing 5 customers at $300 = losing 15 at $100
- ✅ **Competitive moat** - most won't compete at $200-300/month
- ✅ **Room for concierge service** - margins support custom work

**Cons:**
- Harder to find customers (smaller pool)
- Requires stronger trust/positioning
- Need exceptional quality/support

---

### Option C: Push to $500/month (Original Pricing)

- ✅ **True handful** (25-50 customers total)
- ✅ **Extremely personal** - could be on first-name basis
- ✅ **Very high touch viable** - margins support 1-on-1 calls
- ✅ **Zero competition** - nobody else at this price for pre-built agents
- ✅ **Customer champions** - $500/month = they're invested, will evangelize

**Cons:**
- Very hard to find customers (tiny pool)
- Requires exceptional positioning/trust
- Higher churn risk if value isn't obvious

---

### Option D: Push to $1,000/month (Luxury Tier)
**Target:** 10-25 customers
**ARR Goal:** $600K-1.2M
**Positioning:** Luxury concierge automation

- ✅ **Recurring relationship** - like having an automation consultant
- ✅ **Highest margins** - can afford extensive support

## The Math: Same Revenue, Fewer Customers

### Revenue Target: $600K ARR (Year 1)

| Price/Month | Customers Needed | Agents/Customer | Total Support Burden |
|-------------|------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **$100** | 500 customers | 1.2 agents | 600 total agents to maintain |
| **$200** | 250 customers | 1.2 agents | 300 total agents to maintain |
| **$300** | 167 customers | 1.2 agents | 200 total agents to maintain |
| **$500** | 100 customers | 1.2 agents | 120 total agents to maintain |
| **$1,000** | 50 customers | 1.2 agents | 60 total agents to maintain |

**OR** (with multi-agent adoption):

| Price/Month | Customers Needed | Agents/Customer | Your Relationship |
|-------------|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **$100** | 250 | 2 agents | Anonymous customers |
| **$200** | 125 | 2 agents | Know some by name |
| **$300** | 83 | 2.4 agents | Know most by name |
| **$500** | 50 | 2.4 agents | Know ALL by name |
| **$1,000** | 25 | 2.4 agents | Personal relationship with each |
