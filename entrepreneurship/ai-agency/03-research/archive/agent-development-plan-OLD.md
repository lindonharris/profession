## Technical Stack

### n8n (Workflow Engine)
- **Option 1:** Self-hosted (Docker on AWS/GCP)
  - Cost: $200/month (compute + storage)
  - Control: Full customization
- **Option 2:** n8n Cloud (Pro plan)
  - Cost: $50/month per workflow
  - Tradeoff: Less control, faster setup

**Recommendation:** Start with n8n Cloud for speed, migrate to self-hosted at 50+ customers

### AI/ML
- **OpenAI API** (GPT-4 Turbo + Embeddings)
  - Cost: $500-1000/month at scale (40 customers)
  - Use cases: Classification, summarization, tone generation, RAG

### Vector Database
- **Qdrant** (for RAG in WISMO, Refund)
  - Self-hosted: $0 (Docker)
  - Qdrant Cloud: $25/month (starter)

### Storage
- **Postgres** (Supabase free tier or AWS RDS)
  - Cost: $0-100/month
  - Use: Transaction history, logs, learning data
- **Redis** (Upstash free tier)
  - Cost: $0-20/month
  - Use: Caching, session state

### Integrations (Customer provides credentials)
- **Accounting:** QuickBooks, Xero, FreshBooks, Stripe
- **CRM:** Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive
- **E-commerce:** Shopify, Gorgias, Zendesk
- **Communication:** SendGrid, Twilio, Slack

### Total COGS per Customer
```
n8n Cloud: $5/month
OpenAI API: $20-50/month (depends on volume)
Databases: $5/month
Email/SMS: $10/month
Support time: $50/month (1 hour async support)
Total: ~$100/month per customer

At $1.5K average MRR:
Gross Margin: 93% ($1.4K profit per customer)
```

## Risk Mitigation & Contingency Plans

### Risk #1: Build Takes Longer Than Expected
**Mitigation:**
- Modular approach (skip Phase 3 if needed, focus on Phase 1-2)
- Reuse components (80% shared code speeds up later agents)
- Hire contractor if behind schedule (budget $10K for help)

### Risk #2: Customers Don't Buy at $10K Price Point
**Mitigation:**
- Validate pricing in customer discovery calls (Weeks 1-4)
- Offer payment plans ($4K upfront + $500/month for 12 months = $10K total)
- Start lower ($5K) if necessary, increase after testimonials

### Risk #3: Productization Harder Than Expected (Too Much Customization Needed)
**Mitigation:**
- Start with most standardized (E-commerce WISMO, Bookkeeping)
- Say "no" to custom requests (refer to custom dev agency)
- Vertical-specific versions (healthcare vs. legal) instead of one-off customizations

### Risk #4: Support Burden Too High (Not Scalable)
**Mitigation:**
- Self-serve onboarding (video tutorials, setup wizards)
- Async support only (Slack, email - no phone calls)
- Knowledge base (FAQ, troubleshooting guides)
- Hire VA for L1 support at 30 customers ($3K/month)

### Risk #5: Churn Higher Than Expected
**Mitigation:**
- Non-refundable setup fees (sunk cost = stickiness)
- Learning systems (agents improve over time = harder to switch)
- Bundle discounts (multi-product adoption = higher retention)
- Annual contracts (10 months pricing for 12 months commitment)
- Success check-ins (proactive problem-solving)
