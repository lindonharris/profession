# TAM Sizing & Customer Development Validation

**Date:** October 5, 2025
**Purpose:** Validate market size and customer readiness using Customer Development methodology
**Framework:** Steve Blank's Four Steps to the Epiphany + TAM/SAM/SOM analysis

---

## Executive Summary

**Question:** Is there a real, painful, monetizable problem that marketing/creative agencies will pay $12K to solve?

**Validation Status:** üü° PARTIALLY VALIDATED
- ‚úÖ Google Trends shows demand ("automation for agencies" = 30.8 avg)
- ‚úÖ Pricing validated by comparable solutions (VAs = $3K/month)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need customer interviews to validate pain intensity
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to validate willingness to pay $12K specifically
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to validate self-service purchase (vs. sales-led)

---

## TAM/SAM/SOM Framework

### **TAM (Total Addressable Market)**
**Question:** How many businesses could theoretically use our AI agents?

**Market Definition:**
- All US businesses with recurring invoicing needs
- All businesses using QuickBooks, Xero, Stripe, FreshBooks
- Geographic: United States (initially)

**Market Size:**
- Total US businesses: ~33 million
- Businesses with employees (5-50): ~6 million
- Service businesses (agencies, consultancies): ~2 million
- **TAM Estimate:** 2 million businesses

**TAM Revenue Potential:**
- 2M businesses √ó $12K setup = $24B one-time revenue
- 2M businesses √ó $2K/month √ó 12 = $48B annual recurring revenue
- **Total TAM:** ~$72B (unrealistic, but shows ceiling)

**Reality Check:** We'll never capture 100% of TAM. This is theoretical maximum.

---

### **SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)**
**Question:** How many businesses can we realistically REACH with our go-to-market strategy?

**Filters Applied:**
1. **Target Vertical:** Marketing/creative agencies only (not all service businesses)
2. **Size:** 5-50 employees (small enough to need automation, large enough to afford $12K)
3. **Tech-Savvy:** Use QuickBooks/Xero already (indicates willingness to adopt tools)
4. **Geography:** US-based (for initial launch)
5. **Digital Presence:** Active on LinkedIn/Google (can be reached via ads)

**SAM Calculation:**

**Marketing/Creative Agencies in US:**
- Total agencies (Clutch, GoodFirms data): ~150,000
- Agencies with 5-50 employees: ~45,000 (30%)
- Agencies using QuickBooks/Xero: ~31,500 (70% adoption rate)
- **SAM Estimate:** 31,500 agencies

**SAM Revenue Potential:**
- 31,500 agencies √ó $12K setup = $378M one-time
- 31,500 agencies √ó $2K/month √ó 12 = $756M annual recurring
- **Total SAM:** ~$1.1B over 3 years

**Reality Check:** This assumes we can reach every target agency. Still optimistic.

---

### **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)**
**Question:** How many businesses can we realistically CAPTURE in Year 1-3?

**Constraints:**
1. **Budget:** $100K marketing budget Year 1
2. **CAC Target:** $2,000 per customer (LTV:CAC = 17:1)
3. **Conversion Rates:** Industry benchmarks for e-commerce
4. **Competition:** Zapier, Make.com, custom dev agencies
5. **Market Awareness:** "Buy AI automation" is new concept (education needed)

**SOM Calculation (Year 1):**

**Marketing Funnel:**
- Google Ads budget: $50K
- Cost per click: $5 (competitive keyword)
- Clicks: 10,000 visitors
- Landing page conversion: 2% (200 leads)
- Demo/trial conversion: 30% (60 trials)
- Trial ‚Üí paid: 33% (20 customers)
- LinkedIn/organic: +10 customers
- Referrals: +10 customers
- **Year 1 SOM:** 40 customers

**Year 1 Revenue:**
- 40 customers √ó $12K setup = $480K
- 40 customers √ó $2K/month √ó 6 months avg = $240K MRR
- **Total Year 1:** $720K

**Market Share:**
- 40 customers / 31,500 SAM = 0.13% market share
- **SOM as % of SAM:** 0.13% (very achievable)

**Year 2-3 Projections:**
- Year 2: 100 customers (cumulative: 140)
- Year 3: 160 customers (cumulative: 300)
- Year 3 market share: 300/31,500 = 0.95%

## Customer Development Validation Framework

### **Phase 1: Customer Discovery (Before Building)**

#### **Hypothesis to Validate:**

**Problem Hypothesis:**
> "Marketing/creative agencies with 5-50 employees waste 10+ hours/month chasing unpaid invoices, causing cash flow stress and emotional drain. They will pay $12K + $2K/month to eliminate this task entirely."

**Customer Hypothesis:**
> "Agency owners/COOs are the decision-makers. They have budget authority for $10K+ purchases and make decisions based on emotional pain relief ('hate tax'), not just ROI."

**Solution Hypothesis:**
> "A self-service AI agent that auto-sends payment reminders (with escalating tone), flags VIPs for human review, and updates QuickBooks automatically is 10x better than VAs or Zapier workflows."

---

#### **Key Validation Questions (Customer Interviews)**

**PAIN VALIDATION:**
1. "Walk me through your month-end process. What happens when invoices are unpaid?"
2. "How much time do you spend on collections per month?" (Quantify)
3. "On a scale of 1-10, how painful is chasing invoices?" (Emotional intensity)
4. "What have you tried to solve this?" (Current alternatives)
5. "If this problem disappeared, what would that be worth to you?" (WTP discovery)

**SOLUTION VALIDATION:**
6. "If I could automate this 100%, would you trust it?" (Automation anxiety)
7. "Would you need to approve every email, or trust AI?" (Human-in-loop preference)
8. "How would you want to configure this? (Sliders? Checkboxes?)" (UX preferences)
9. "QuickBooks or Xero?" (Integration validation)
10. "Do you use Zapier/Make today?" (Technical sophistication)

**PRICING VALIDATION:**
11. "How much do you pay for QuickBooks/bookkeeper/tools?" (Anchoring)
12. "If this saved 10 hours/month, what's that worth?" (Value-based pricing)
13. "Would you pay $12K upfront or $500/month for 24 months?" (Payment structure)
14. "What would make $12K feel like a 'no-brainer'?" (Value drivers)
15. "At what price would this feel 'too expensive' or 'too cheap'?" (Van Westendorp)

**PURCHASE VALIDATION:**
16. "How do you buy software today? (Online? Sales call?)" (Sales motion)
17. "Who else needs to approve a $12K purchase?" (Decision-making unit)
18. "How long does procurement take?" (Sales cycle length)
19. "Would you buy this sight-unseen, or need a demo?" (Self-service feasibility)
20. "If I had this ready tomorrow, would you buy it?" (Urgency test)

---

### **Phase 2: Customer Validation (After MVP Built)**

**Goal:** Get 10 paying customers to validate product-market fit

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ 10 customers pay $10K+ (validates pricing)
- ‚úÖ 80%+ say "I'd be very disappointed if this disappeared" (Sean Ellis test)
- ‚úÖ <5 hours support per customer (validates self-service)
- ‚úÖ 90%+ of invoices successfully auto-followed up (validates product quality)
- ‚úÖ 50%+ willing to refer (validates "love it" level satisfaction)

**Validation Metrics:**

| Metric | Target | Validates |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Payment conversion | >30% of trials | Price is right |
| Setup time | <3 hours | Self-service works |
| Support tickets | <5/customer/month | Product is intuitive |
| Churn rate | <10% in first 3 months | Solving real problem |
| NPS score | >50 | Strong product-market fit |
| Referrals | >20% refer a friend | "Love it" level |

---

### **Phase 3: Customer Creation (Scaling)**

**Goal:** Prove repeatable, scalable customer acquisition

**Validation Questions:**
1. Can we acquire customers for <$2K CAC?
2. Do customers self-serve, or need hand-holding?
3. What channels work? (Google Ads? LinkedIn? Content?)
4. What's our viral coefficient? (K-factor >1 = organic growth)
5. Can one person handle 100+ customers?

---

## Market Validation: What We Know (Google Trends Data)

### **‚úÖ VALIDATED:**

**Demand Exists:**
- "automation for agencies" = 30.8 avg interest (stable, established demand)
- "ai automation tools" = 36.1 avg interest (growing category)
- "buy ai automation" = 26.4 avg interest (purchase intent exists)

**Target is Right:**
- Agencies = highest vertical interest (30.8 vs. others)
- Validates focusing on agencies first

**Language Matters:**
- "Buy AI automation" works (26.4 avg)
- "AI agent marketplace" doesn't work (falling trend)

### **‚ö†Ô∏è NOT YET VALIDATED:**

**Pain Intensity:**
- Google Trends shows SEARCH interest, not PAIN intensity
- Need interviews: "How painful is this on a scale of 1-10?"
- Need to confirm "hate tax" applies (emotional premium)

**Willingness to Pay $12K:**
- Trends show search volume, not price sensitivity
- Need to validate: "Would you pay $12K for this?"
- Need to validate: "What's the max you'd pay?"

**Self-Service Feasibility:**
- Trends don't tell us if agencies will buy online (no sales call)
- Need to validate: "Would you buy this without talking to anyone?"
- Risk: Agencies might expect hand-holding for $12K purchase

**Product-Specific Demand:**
- "ai for invoicing" rising (21.9 avg) - validates Invoice agent
- "ai bookkeeping" stable (31.2 avg) - validates Bookkeeping agent
- But doesn't validate our SPECIFIC product (pre-built, self-service)

---

   - How to validate: Filter for "marketing agency" + "5-50 employees" + "US"

2. **What % of agencies have invoice collection pain?**
   - Assumption: 80% (need to validate via interviews)
   - Risk: Maybe only 20% have this pain acutely

3. **What % use QuickBooks/Xero?**
   - Assumption: 70% (industry reports)
   - Risk: Maybe agencies use custom tools we can't integrate with

11. **What's the right payment structure?**
    - Option A: $12K upfront + $2K/month (capital-intensive)
    - Option B: $0 upfront + $500/month for 24 months (lower barrier)
    - Need to validate: Which converts better?

12. **What's the #1 feature that must work?**
    - Hypothesis: Auto-send reminders with escalating tone
    - Need to validate: What if they want to customize email templates?

### **PHASE 1 DECISION POINT**

**After 2-4 hours of manual research, you should know:**

| Question | Evidence | Go/No-Go |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Is pain real? | 5+ Reddit threads with high engagement | ‚úÖ or ‚ùå |
| Is market big? | 20,000+ agencies found | ‚úÖ or ‚ùå |
| Is price competitive? | VAs cost $800-3K/month | ‚úÖ or ‚ùå |
| Will they self-serve? | 3+ examples of self-service B2B >$5K | ‚úÖ or ‚ùå |
| Who's the buyer? | Job postings confirm AR responsibility | ‚úÖ or ‚ùå |

**IF ALL ‚úÖ ‚Üí Proceed to Phase 2 (build automation)**
**IF ANY ‚ùå ‚Üí STOP. Pivot before investing more time.**
