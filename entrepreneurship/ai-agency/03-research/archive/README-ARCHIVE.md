# Research Archive - Strategic Pivot (October 5, 2025)

**Why This Research Was Archived:**

On October 5, 2025, we made a fundamental strategic pivot from boutique high-touch service to democratized self-service platform.

## What Changed

### OLD Strategy (Archived Research)
- **Product:** Single high-touch customer-facing agent (Invoice & Collections)
- **Pricing:** $12,000 setup + $2,000/month
- **Target:** Marketing/creative agencies (5-50 employees)
- **Buyer:** Agency Operations Manager (requires CEO approval)
- **Model:** Sales-led with white-glove onboarding
- **Positioning:** Premium VA replacement

### NEW Strategy (Current)
- **Product:** Marketplace of 20+ simple internal agents
- **Pricing:** $500/month per agent (no setup fee)
- **Target:** Productivity-focused small businesses (1-50 employees: solo entrepreneurs, freelancers, consultants, agencies)
- **Buyer:** Individual decision maker (no approval needed)
- **Model:** 100% self-service with 1-click activation
- **Positioning:** Pre-built alternative to Zapier's DIY approach

## Why We Pivoted

**Founder Constraints:**
- Cannot do sales calls / custom onboarding (time constraint)
- Want self-service scalability from Day 1
- Low overhead allows aggressive pricing

**Market Opportunity:**
- Zapier's complexity is a widespread pain point
- Democratization of AI automation is the thesis
- Broader market (all small businesses vs just agencies)

**Product Feasibility:**
- Internal agents are simpler (avoid customer-facing complexity)
- Can launch 5 agents in Month 1 (vs 1 complex agent in 3 months)
- Lower stakes = easier self-service setup

## Archived Research Summary

These documents validated the OLD strategy but are no longer applicable:

1. **phase1-pain-validation.md** - Validated invoice collection pain (not relevant to internal agents)
2. **phase1-market-sizing.md** - Sized agency market at 9K-12K (now targeting 100K+ businesses)
3. **phase1-competitive-pricing.md** - Compared to VAs (now competing with Zapier)
4. **phase1-buyer-persona.md** - Validated Agency Ops Manager (now targeting solo entrepreneurs)
5. **phase1-self-service-feasibility.md** - Found $12K too high for self-service (now $500/month)
6. **phase1-findings.md** - Concluded to proceed with $12K AR agent (no longer valid)

## What We Kept

- **Customer development methodology** (still valid approach)
- **Research rigor** (citation-heavy, evidence-based)
- **Two-phase validation** (manual quick check, then automated deep dive)

## What We're Building Instead

See current documentation:
- **start.md** - New strategy overview
- **agent-catalog.md** - 20+ simple internal agents
- **competitive-analysis.md** - vs Zapier, Make, n8n
- **marketplace-ux.md** - Self-service marketplace UI

**Note:** This research was valuable for learning customer development methodology, but the business model pivot made these specific findings obsolete. We chose NOT to redo Phase 1 research for the new strategy - instead, we're validating with an MVP (build 5 agents, sell to 10 customers, iterate based on feedback).
