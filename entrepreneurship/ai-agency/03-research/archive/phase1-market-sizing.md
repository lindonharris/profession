## Market Sizing Methodology

### Step 1: Identify Total Market (TAM)

**Sources with Business Counts:**
1. RocketReach: 37,214 agencies (all sizes)
2. SICCODE.com: 11,524 agencies (verified, all sizes)

**Variance Analysis:**
- RocketReach is 3.2x larger than SICCODE
- Possible reasons:
  - RocketReach includes unverified/emerging businesses
  - SICCODE has stricter verification criteria
  - RocketReach may include related NAICS codes
  - SICCODE may be older data

**Conservative TAM:** 11,524 agencies (SICCODE)
**Optimistic TAM:** 37,214 agencies (RocketReach)
**Most Likely TAM:** ~20,000-25,000 agencies (average + adjustment)

### Step 2: Filter to Target Segment (SAM)

**Target Profile:**
- Employee count: 5-50 employees
- Industry: Marketing/creative agencies
- Geography: United States
- Tech adoption: Use QuickBooks, Xero, or similar

**Industry Distribution (Standard)**
According to SBA statistics (not directly cited in this research):
- 1-4 employees: ~50% of service businesses
- 5-9 employees: ~20%
- 10-19 employees: ~15%
- 20-49 employees: ~10%
- 50+ employees: ~5%

**Our target range (5-50 employees):** ~45% of total market

**But our research shows larger agencies:**
- Example from RocketReach: MediaCom (5K), Interpublic (26K), Criteo (4K)
- Suggests NAICS 54181 skews larger than typical service business

**Adjusted estimate:** 30-40% are 5-50 employee range

### Step 3: Calculate SAM

**Conservative Scenario (SICCODE base):**
- TAM: 11,524 agencies
- Target %: 30%
- **SAM: 3,457 agencies**

**Moderate Scenario (SICCODE base, higher %):**
- TAM: 11,524 agencies
- Target %: 40%
- **SAM: 4,610 agencies**

**Optimistic Scenario (RocketReach base):**
- TAM: 37,214 agencies
- Target %: 30%
- **SAM: 11,164 agencies**

**Most Optimistic Scenario (RocketReach base, higher %):**
- TAM: 37,214 agencies
- Target %: 40%
- **SAM: 14,886 agencies**

**Recommended SAM Estimate:** 9,000-12,000 agencies
- Based on: Mid-point between conservative and optimistic
- Rationale: Truth likely between SICCODE and RocketReach counts

## Validation Against Minimum Viable Market

**Question:** Is 3,457 agencies (worst case) enough to build a business?

**Analysis:**

**Scenario 1: Conservative SAM (3,457 agencies)**
- Target market share Year 1: 1% = 35 customers
- Revenue at 35 customers: 35 × $36K (Year 1) = $1.26M
- **Verdict:** ✅ VIABLE - $1.26M is sufficient for solo founder

**Scenario 2: Moderate SAM (9,000 agencies)**
- Target market share Year 1: 0.5% = 45 customers
- Revenue at 45 customers: 45 × $36K = $1.62M
- **Verdict:** ✅ STRONG - Market 2.6x larger than minimum needed

**Scenario 3: Optimistic SAM (14,886 agencies)**
- Target market share Year 1: 0.3% = 45 customers
- Revenue at 45 customers: 45 × $36K = $1.62M
- **Verdict:** ✅ EXCELLENT - Can achieve target with tiny market share

**Conclusion:** Even worst-case scenario (3,457 agencies) supports viable business

---

## Geographic Distribution (Preliminary)

**Note:** None of sources provided state-level breakdowns in snippets accessed

**Expected Distribution (Based on US Business Patterns):**
Top states for advertising agencies:
1. California (likely 15-20% of total)
2. New York (likely 10-15%)
3. Texas (likely 8-10%)
4. Florida (likely 5-8%)
5. Illinois (likely 5-7%)

**Phase 2 Action:** Access Census Bureau County Business Patterns for state-level data

## Data Quality Assessment

### Confidence Levels by Source

| Source | Data Type | Business Count | Credibility | Recency | Usefulness |
|--------|-----------|----------------|-------------|---------|------------|
| RocketReach | Commercial DB | 37,214 | High | Current | High |
| SICCODE.com | Verified DB | 11,524 | High | Unknown | High |
| IBISWorld | Research Report | Unknown* | Very High | Sept 2025 | Medium** |
| FRED | Gov Data | N/A*** | Highest | Sept 2025 | Low**** |
| BLS | Gov Data | N/A*** | Highest | Current | Medium***** |

*Full count behind paywall
**Useful if purchased
***Employment data, not business count
****For market sizing specifically
*****For wage/validation research

### Overall Assessment

**Data Availability:** MODERATE
- Two sources with actual counts (RocketReach, SICCODE)
- Three sources with supporting data (IBISWorld, FRED, BLS)
- Government sources (Census) not directly accessed yet

**Data Reliability:** HIGH
- Commercial databases are credible
- Government data is available (just not accessed)
- Multiple sources corroborate industry exists and is sizable

**Data Precision:** LOW-MODERATE
- Wide variance (11K - 37K total agencies)
- No source provides filtered count for 5-50 employees
- Estimates required (30-40% assumption)

**Recommendation:** Phase 2 automation should directly access:
1. Census Bureau County Business Patterns (free, precise, government)
2. LinkedIn company search (filtered by size, free count)
3. Clutch.co (agency directory scraping, free)

---

## Research Limitations

**1. No Direct Employee Size Filtering:**
- Both RocketReach and SICCODE show total agencies (all sizes)
- Our 30-40% estimate is assumption, not data
- Need filtered count in Phase 2

**2. Data Recency Unknown:**
- SICCODE date not specified
- RocketReach may include defunct businesses
- Need current, cleaned data

**3. NAICS Code Scope:**
- 54181 is specifically "Advertising Agencies"
- May not include: Marketing agencies, Creative agencies, Digital agencies
- Related codes: 54161 (Marketing Consulting) not researched yet

**4. No QuickBooks/Xero Adoption Data:**
- Assume 70% use QuickBooks/Xero (industry reports)
- Not validated for agencies specifically
- Could further reduce SAM if adoption is lower

**5. Geographic Limitation:**
- US-only (as intended)
- No validation that all listed agencies are US-based
- RocketReach may include international HQs
