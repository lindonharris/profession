# Archive: Old Strategy Documents

**Archived:** October 6, 2025
**Reason:** Strategic pivot from boutique model to two-tier marketplace

---

## What Changed

### OLD Strategy (Archived Here)
- **Business Model:** High-touch boutique service
- **Pricing:** $12K setup + $2K/month
- **Target:** Marketing agencies only
- **Sales:** Sales-led with white-glove onboarding
- **MVP Agents:** 5 agents (Social Media, Meeting Notes, Email Digest, Social Repurpose, Document Org)
- **Selection Method:** Tool list validation (Q9)

### NEW Strategy (Current - See Root Directory)
- **Business Model:** Self-service AI agent marketplace
- **Pricing:** Two-tier ($100 Self-Service + $300 Premium)
- **Target:** All productivity-focused small businesses
- **Sales:** 100% self-service
- **MVP Agents:** 2 agents (Invoice Reminder, Lead Qualification)
- **Selection Method:** Competitive intelligence + Reddit demand validation

---

## Why We Pivoted

**From Competitive Intelligence Research:**
- **19 Reddit requests** for invoice automation (explicit demand)
- **16 Reddit requests** for lead qualification
- **0 Reddit requests** for social media scheduling in research sample
- **Lower competition:** Invoice = 5-6 tools, Lead Qualification = 2-3 tools vs Social Media = 10+ tools
- **Business impact:** Cash flow (survival) > content creation (nice-to-have)

**Key Insight:**
"Tool list presence ≠ unmet demand. Tool list presence = saturated market."
