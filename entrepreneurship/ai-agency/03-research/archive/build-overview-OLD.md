# How to Build buyanagent.ai (Plain English)

**Last Updated:** October 6, 2025 (Research-Validated Strategy)
**Purpose:** Step-by-step guide to building the AI agent marketplace
**Audience:** You (the founder) when you need a refresher on what to build
**Research Basis:** Phase 2 Customer Development (Q4-Q9, 100% validation rate)

---

## The Big Picture

We're building **"The Shopify App Store for AI Agents"** - a research-validated two-tier marketplace where small businesses browse pre-built AI agents, choose Utility Tier ($29-79/month) or Premium Tier ($100-150/month), complete a 15-30 minute setup wizard, and automate their business.

**What This Strategy Is Built On:**

**Phase 2 Research (October 2025):** 6 critical questions, 100% pass rate
- ✅ **Q4:** 20% tier upgrade rates validated (industry standard)
- ✅ **Q5:** $300 white-glove service proven profitable (38% margin)
- ✅ **Q6:** $100 impulse purchase threshold confirmed (requires ROI messaging)
- ✅ **Q7:** Only 2-3 direct competitors (whitespace at $100-300 tier)
- ✅ **Q8:** "Pre-built" positioning unclaimed (vs DIY workflows)
- ✅ **Q9:** Social Media + Meeting Notes = highest demand agents

**See:** `/research/phase2-validation/` for full research files and `/PRICING-DECISION-FINAL.md` for strategy details.

**What's Different from Old Plan:**
- ❌ NOT a single high-touch product ($12K + sales calls)
- ✅ YES a self-service marketplace with two tiers
- ✅ **MVP launches with 5 agents** (3 Utility + 2 Premium) - Tiered strategy validated
- ✅ Phased rollout: Utility tier first (Weeks 1-5, $29-79/month), Premium tier second (Weeks 6-10, $100-150/month)
- ✅ Broader market access with low-cost entry point ($29 Email Sweeper)

**Agent Selection:** See `/MVP-AGENTS-FINAL.md`
- **Utility Tier:** Email Sweeper ($29-39), Newsletter Digester ($49-59), Expense Manager ($69-79)
- **Premium Tier:** Invoice Chaser ($100), Lead Qualification ($100-150)
- **Rationale:** Tiered pricing matches value delivered (invisible automation vs business intelligence)

## Three Parallel Tracks

### Track 1: Build the Marketplace (How Customers Buy)
**Tools:** Lovable + Supabase + Stripe
**Timeline:** 4 weeks
**Output:** buyanagent.ai website where customers browse and activate agents

### Track 2: Build the Agents (What Customers Buy)
**Tools:** n8n Cloud + GPT-4
**Timeline:** Phased - Utility agents 1-2 weeks each, Premium agents 3-4 weeks each (with dashboards)
**Output:** 5 working agents (3 Utility + 2 Premium) ready to sell

### Track 3: Launch & Market
**Timeline:** Week 6 onwards
**Output:** Customers using agents, revenue flowing

**You can work on Track 1 and Track 2 in parallel or sequentially. Recommended: Build marketplace first (Track 1), then add agents one by one (Track 2).**

---

## Track 1: Build the Marketplace

### Step 1: Make It Look Amazing (Lovable UI Generation)

**What is Lovable?**
- AI tool that generates React + Tailwind code from natural language
- You describe what you want, it builds it in seconds
- Example: "Create a product card grid with hover effects" → Done

**What to Build:**

**Homepage:**
```
Prompt to Lovable:
"Create a modern SaaS homepage with:
- Hero section with gradient headline 'Pre-Built AI Agents. Activate in 1 Click.'
- Subheadline explaining we're alternative to Zapier
- Two CTAs: 'Browse Agents' (primary) and 'Watch Demo' (secondary)
- Grid of agent cards (3 columns on desktop)
- Each card has: emoji icon, agent name, 1-line description, price, 'Activate' button
- Footer with links"

Lovable will generate the code. Export it.
```

**Agent Detail Page:**
```
Prompt to Lovable:
"Create a product detail page with:
- Large emoji icon + agent name as headline
- 2-3 paragraph description
- 'How It Works' 3-step visual (icon → icon → icon with arrows)
- List of integrations required (with logos)
- Pricing varies by agent:
  - Utility agents: Single price ($29-79/month) with status page
  - Premium agents: Tier selector (Utility tier with status page OR Premium tier with dashboard)
- Big CTA button 'Activate Agent' (Utility) or 'Choose Your Tier' (Premium)
- Customer reviews section (5 stars, quotes)
- FAQ accordion"
```

**Dashboard:**
```
Prompt to Lovable:
"Create a dashboard with:
- Sidebar navigation (My Agents, Billing, Settings)
- Main content area showing active agents as cards
- Each agent card: icon, name, tier (Utility/Premium), price, status (active/paused), last run time, actions (Settings, Upgrade [Utility only], Pause, Cancel)
- Control panels integrated into each agent card (Essential + Agent-specific controls)
- 'Browse More Agents' CTA at bottom"
```

**Action:**
1. Sign up for Lovable (lovable.dev)
2. Create new project called "buyanagent-marketplace"
3. Generate all 3 layouts above
4. Export code to GitHub repo
5. **Time: 2-3 days** (iterating with Lovable to get design perfect)

---

### Step 2: Set Up the Database (Supabase)

**What is Supabase?**
- Postgres database + authentication + real-time subscriptions
- Like Firebase but with SQL (easier to query)
- Free tier, then $25/month

**What to Create:**

**Tables Needed:**
1. `users` - Customer accounts (managed by Supabase Auth)
2. `agent_templates` - The 20+ agents we offer
3. `user_agents` - Which agents each user has activated
4. `oauth_integrations` - User's connected services (Gmail, Sheets, etc.)
5. `subscriptions` - Stripe subscription tracking
6. `agent_activity_logs` - For dashboard analytics

**Action:**
1. Create Supabase account (supabase.com)
2. Create new project "buyanagent-marketplace"
3. Copy SQL from vision.md "Database Schema" section
4. Paste into Supabase SQL editor
5. Run the SQL to create all tables
6. Enable Row Level Security (RLS) policies
7. **Time: 2-3 hours**

**See vision.md for complete SQL schema.**

---

### Step 3: Connect Payments (Stripe)

**What is Stripe?**
- Payment processor (handles credit cards, subscriptions)
- 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
- Industry standard for SaaS

**How It Works:**
- User clicks "Choose Your Tier" → Selects Self-Service ($100) or Premium ($300)
- Stripe Checkout modal opens
- User enters credit card → Stripe creates subscription ($100 or $300/month)
- Stripe sends webhook → Your backend activates the agent
- Premium tier: Schedule onboarding call automatically
- Every month: Stripe auto-charges, sends webhook, you keep agent running

**What to Build:**

**Checkout Flow:**
```javascript
// When user clicks "Choose Your Tier" button
async function createCheckoutSession(agentId, userId, tier) {
  // tier = 'self_service' or 'premium'
  const priceId = tier === 'premium'
    ? 'price_agent_300_monthly'
    : 'price_agent_100_monthly';

  const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
    mode: 'subscription',
    line_items: [{
      price: priceId, // Created in Stripe Dashboard
      quantity: 1,
    }],
    metadata: {
      user_id: userId,
      agent_template_id: agentId,
      tier: tier
    },
    success_url: 'https://buyanagent.ai/activation-wizard?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}',
    cancel_url: 'https://buyanagent.ai/agents/{agentId}'
  });

  return session.url; // Redirect user to this URL
}
```

**Webhook Handler:**
```javascript
// Stripe calls this when subscription created
app.post('/webhooks/stripe', async (req, res) => {
  const event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(req.body, req.headers['stripe-signature'], webhookSecret);

  if (event.type === 'customer.subscription.created') {
    // Insert into subscriptions table
    // Update user_agents table (status = 'active')
  }

  if (event.type === 'customer.subscription.deleted') {
    // Update user_agents table (status = 'cancelled')
    // Delete n8n workflow
  }

  res.json({received: true});
});
```

**Action:**
1. Create Stripe account (stripe.com)
2. Create product: "AI Agent Subscription"
3. Use dynamic pricing (price_data in checkout instead of fixed price IDs):
   - Utility Tier: Agent-specific pricing ($29-79/month)
   - Premium Tier: Agent-specific pricing ($100-150/month)
4. Store agent pricing in Supabase agent_templates table
5. Get API keys (test mode first)
6. Build checkout flow with tier selection (code above)
7. Build webhook handler (code above)
8. Test with Stripe test cards (all price points)
9. **Time: 1-2 days**

---

### Step 4: Build Activation Wizard (Multi-Step Form)

**What is the Wizard?**
- 5-step form that runs after user subscribes
- Connects their Gmail/Sheets via OAuth
- Configures the agent (categories, rules, etc.)
- Tests the agent with sample data
- Deploys the agent to n8n

**What to Build:**

**Step 1: Connect Integrations**
```
Show cards for each integration:
┌─────────────────────┐
│ [Gmail logo]        │
│ Gmail               │
│ For scanning emails │
│                     │
│ [Connect →]         │
└─────────────────────┘

When user clicks "Connect":
- OAuth popup opens (Supabase Auth handles this)
- User authorizes app
- Token stored in oauth_integrations table
- Card updates: [✓ Connected]
```

**Step 2: Configure Rules**
```
For Expense Tracker example:
- Checkboxes for categories: □ Travel □ Meals □ Software
- Dropdown for notification frequency
- Text input for Google Sheet URL

Save config to user_agents.config (JSONB column)
```

**Step 3: Test Agent**
```
Backend:
1. Clone n8n template for this agent
2. Inject user's OAuth tokens
3. Run test execution with sample data
4. Return results

Frontend:
- Show loading spinner: "Testing agent..."
- Show results: "✓ Found 1 receipt, extracted $42.50 from Starbucks, categorized as Meals"
- User clicks "Looks good!" to proceed
```

**Step 4: Activate**
```
Backend:
1. Save n8n workflow permanently
2. Activate workflow (starts running)
3. Update user_agents.status = 'active'

Frontend:
- Success screen: "🎉 Agent is live!"
- Link to dashboard
```

**Action:**
1. Use Lovable to generate wizard UI (5-step progress bar + forms)
2. Build OAuth flow with Supabase Auth
3. Build backend endpoints for test/activate
4. Connect to n8n API (see Step 5 below)
5. **Time: 4-5 days**

---

### Step 5: Deploy Agents to n8n (Backend Logic)

**What is n8n?**
- Visual workflow automation tool (like Zapier)
- 350+ integrations (Gmail, Sheets, Slack, etc.)
- Open-source, can self-host or use cloud
- We use n8n Cloud: $50/month

**How It Works:**
1. You build agent workflow once (template)
2. When user activates, backend clones template
3. Backend injects user's OAuth tokens + config
4. Backend saves and activates workflow
5. Workflow runs automatically (daily, hourly, or trigger-based)

**What to Build:**

**Agent Template (Example: Expense Tracker):**
```
Build in n8n visual editor:
1. Gmail Trigger (watches for new emails with attachments)
2. Filter (only receipts/invoices)
3. OpenAI (GPT-4 extracts vendor, amount, date, category)
4. Function (maps to user's categories)
5. Google Sheets (appends row)

Save as template in n8n.
```

**Deployment Code:**
```javascript
// When user completes wizard
async function deployAgent(userId, agentTemplateId, config, oauthTokens) {
  // 1. Clone template
  const template = await n8nAPI.getTemplate(agentTemplateId);

  // 2. Inject tokens
  template.credentials.gmail = await n8nAPI.createCredential('gmail', oauthTokens.gmail);
  template.credentials.sheets = await n8nAPI.createCredential('google-sheets', oauthTokens.sheets);

  // 3. Inject config
  template.nodes.find(n => n.name === 'Categorize').parameters.categories = config.categories;

  // 4. Save workflow
  const workflow = await n8nAPI.createWorkflow(template);

  // 5. Activate
  await n8nAPI.activateWorkflow(workflow.id);

  // 6. Store workflow ID
  await supabase.from('user_agents').update({
    n8n_workflow_id: workflow.id
  }).eq('id', userAgentId);
}
```

**Action:**
1. Sign up for n8n Cloud (n8n.io)
2. Build first agent workflow (Expense Tracker)
3. Test with your own Gmail/Sheets
4. Get n8n API key
5. Build deployment code (above)
6. Test end-to-end: User activates → Workflow deploys → Agent runs
7. **Time: 3-4 days**

---

### Step 6: Build Dashboard (Customer Self-Service)

**What Users See:**
```
My Agents (3 active)

┌────────────────────────────────┐

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Pitfall 1: Building too many agents before getting customers**
- ❌ Don't: Build all 20 agents before launching
- ✅ Do: Launch with 5 agents, build more based on demand

**Pitfall 2: Over-engineering the wizard**
- ❌ Don't: Make wizard perfect with every edge case handled
- ✅ Do: Build basic wizard, improve based on user feedback

**Pitfall 3: Ignoring mobile**
- ❌ Don't: Only test on desktop
- ✅ Do: Test on iPhone, Android from Day 1

**Pitfall 4: No analytics**
- ❌ Don't: Launch blind without tracking
- ✅ Do: Set up Google Analytics + PostHog before launch

**Pitfall 5: Trying to be Zapier**
- ❌ Don't: Add workflow builder, custom integrations
- ✅ Do: Stay focused on pre-built agents only

---

## When You Get Stuck

**Lovable not generating good UI?**
- Be more specific in prompts
- Show it examples: "Make it look like stripe.com homepage"
- Iterate 3-5 times

**Supabase Row Level Security confusing?**
- Start with policies disabled (development only)
- Add RLS before public launch
- Use Supabase docs: supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/row-level-security

**Stripe webhooks not working?**
- Use Stripe CLI to test locally: `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/webhooks`
- Check webhook signature verification
- Log everything to debug

**n8n workflow not deploying?**
- Test workflow manually in n8n UI first
- Check OAuth tokens are valid (not expired)
- Use n8n's error logs

**No customers?**
- Post on Reddit (r/entrepreneur, r/solopreneur)
- Offer lifetime deal on Product Hunt
- DM 100 people on LinkedIn
