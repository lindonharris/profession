### 2. Stripe Pricing Guidance: $199-249 + Concierge Onboarding

**Source:** Stripe Atlas SaaS Pricing Guide

**Quote:**
> "I'd price $199 to $249 immediately (since they're perceived as the same amount by users); I'd probably price it higher than that, too, after you have dialed in the value provided via, for example, concierge onboarding."

**Stripe's Recommendation:**
- Base price: $199-249/month
- **Add concierge onboarding** to justify premium pricing
- Positioning: White-glove service allows you to charge **more than $250/month**

**Application to Our Model:**
- Our Premium tier: $300/month
- Includes: White-glove onboarding (30-min call), custom tweaks, priority support
- **Assessment:** ✅ **Aligns with Stripe's recommendation** to price higher when including concierge service

### 3. Real-World Case Study: $100 → $300 Price Increase

**Source:** Baremetrics SaaS Pricing Models

**Jordan Gal - Carthook Case Study:**

**Quote:**
> "Pricing started at $100/month because that's where the incumbent was and we figured it was a good starting point. We got overwhelmed with demand so we moved to **$300/month** to slow things down. **Demand stayed exactly the same!**"

**Key Findings:**
- Started at $100/month (same as our Self-Service tier)
- **Increased to $300/month** (same as our Premium tier)
- Demand unchanged → **customers willing to pay 3x for same product**
- Implication: If product value is strong, **$300/month is acceptable pricing**

**Relevance:** This validates that customers will pay **$300/month** when they perceive sufficient value. Our differentiation (white-glove vs DIY) creates additional justification.
