## 🎯 Key Decisions (Aligned Across All Docs)

### **Strategic Positioning**
- **Tagline:** "Zapier is for building automation. buyanagent.ai is for buying it pre-built."
- **Value Prop:** Activate in 1 click vs 10 hours building in Zapier
- **Competitive Edge:** Pre-built agents (not DIY), 30-min setup (not 10 hours), zero learning curve

### **Target Customer**
- **Primary:** All productivity-focused small businesses (freelancers, agencies, startups)
- **Why Changed:** Marketplace scales better than niche (agencies only)
- **Activation Pattern:** Solo freelancers (1-2 agents), Agencies (3-5 agents), SaaS companies (5-10 agents)

### **Business Model**
- **What:** Self-service marketplace (buyanagent.ai) selling pre-built AI agents
- **How:** Browse agents → 1-click purchase → Setup wizard → Agent activates
- **Tech:** Lovable (UI) + Supabase (DB) + Stripe (payments) + n8n Cloud (agents) + Vercel (hosting)

### **Pricing**
**Two-Tier Model:** (Value-Based, Not Cost-Based)

**Utility Tier:** $29-79/month per agent
- Email Sweeper ($29-39), Newsletter Digester ($49-59), Expense Manager ($69-79)
- **Interface:** Simple status pages (health + activity metrics)
- **Value Prop:** "Set it and forget it" invisible automation
- **vs Competitors:** 2-4x Clean Email/SaneBox/Unroll.me/Expensify BUT AI-powered

**Premium Tier:** $100-150/month per agent
- Invoice Chaser ($100), Lead Qualification ($100-150)
- **Interface:** Full analytics dashboards (charts, trends, insights)
- **Value Prop:** Business intelligence + measurable ROI
- **vs Competitors:** 50% less than Bonsai/Clearbit BUT includes dashboard + no bloat

**No Bundling Initially:** Validate individual agent pricing first (revisit post-MVP)

### **Launch Product Lineup** (5 Agents - Two Tiers)

**Utility Tier** (Invisible Automation - $29-79/month):
1. **Email Sweeper** ($29-39) - Unsubscribe + delete + archive email noise
2. **Newsletter Digester** ($49-59) - AI summarizes newsletters daily
3. **Expense Manager** ($69-79) - Scans receipts, auto-categorizes to Google Sheets

**Premium Tier** (Dashboard + Intelligence - $100-150/month):
4. **Invoice Chaser** ($100) - Payment reminders + DSO analytics dashboard
5. **Lead Qualification** ($100-150) - AI scoring + pipeline dashboard

**Phased Rollout:** Utility tier first (Weeks 1-5), Premium tier second (Weeks 6-10)

### **Domain**
- **Primary:** buyanagent.ai (available)
- **Why:** Perfect CTA ("Buy an Agent"), .ai domain credibility, marketplace positioning

---

## 🚫 What NOT to Confuse

### **Strategic Pivot - OLD vs NEW:**

**OLD Strategy (Archived):**
- ❌ Boutique service model with sales calls
- ❌ Customer-facing agents (Invoice & Collections for agency clients)
- ❌ Pricing: $12K setup + $2K/month
- ❌ Target: Marketing/creative agencies only
- ❌ 7 complex agents requiring extensive onboarding

**NEW Strategy (Current):**
- ✅ Self-service marketplace (100% self-serve)
- ✅ Internal agents (Expense Tracker for the business owner themselves)
- ✅ Pricing: $100/month per agent (no setup fee)
- ✅ Target: All productivity-focused small businesses
- ✅ 22 simple agents with 30-min activation

### **Common Misunderstandings:**

**❌ WRONG:** "This is like Zapier (build your own)"
**✅ RIGHT:** "This is the OPPOSITE of Zapier - buy it pre-built, activate in 1 click"

**❌ WRONG:** "We're targeting agencies because of Google Trends research"
**✅ RIGHT:** "We're targeting ALL small businesses now - agencies are just one customer segment"

**❌ WRONG:** "Agents interact with customer's customers (like AR automation)"
**✅ RIGHT:** "Agents are internal tools (like expense tracking, meeting notes) - no customer-facing"

**❌ WRONG:** "This is a high-touch consulting model"
**✅ RIGHT:** "This is a no-touch product model (like buying a Shopify app)"

## 💡 Why We Pivoted Strategy

**OLD Strategy Problems (research-archive/):**
- ❌ Customer-facing agents = high complexity (email, collections, WISMO)
- ❌ $12K setup + $2K/month = hard to sell without sales team
- ❌ Agencies-only = limited market (niche too narrow)
- ❌ Boutique service = doesn't scale (custom work for each customer)

**NEW Strategy Advantages:**
- ✅ Internal agents = simple (expense tracking, meeting notes)
- ✅ $100/month = impulse purchase (no sales call needed)
- ✅ All small businesses = massive market (freelancers, agencies, startups)
- ✅ Marketplace = scales infinitely (same 22 agents for all customers)

**Competitive Insight (01-strategy/competitive-analysis.md):**
- Zapier/Make/n8n force users to spend 10 hours building
- We save them 10 hours by selling pre-built
- Compete on TIME and SIMPLICITY, not price or features
