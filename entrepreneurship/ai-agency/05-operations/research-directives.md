# Research Directives: Two-Tier Marketplace Validation

**Last Updated:** October 5, 2025 (Updated for two-tier pricing strategy)
**Status:** Ready to Execute
**Purpose:** Validate the TWO-TIER marketplace strategy (Self-Service $100 + Premium $300)
**Old Research:** Archived (validated wrong model - boutique service at $12K)
**Pricing Evolution:**
- Original: $500/month per agent
- Revised: $100/month per agent (after Q2/Q3 research)
- **FINAL: Two-tier model - $100 Self-Service + $300 Premium**

---

## What Changed (Why We Need New Research)

### OLD Strategy (Archived Research Validated):
- ✅ Pain validated: Agencies have invoice/AR pain
- ✅ Market sized: 10K+ agencies in target segment
- ✅ Pricing validated: $12K competitive with VA costs
- ❌ **BUT:** Wrong business model (high-touch service doesn't scale)

### NEW Strategy (Needs Validation):
- ❓ Pain: Do small businesses pay for **internal** automation tools?
- ❓ Market: How many SMBs buy **pre-built** agents vs DIY?
- ❓ Pricing: Is **$100/month** impulse purchase for Self-Service tier?
- ❓ Premium Tier: Can we get 100+ customers at **$300/month** with white-glove service?
- ❓ Competition: Are we differentiated at both price points ($100 vs Zapier, $300 vs agencies)?
- ❓ Activation: Will users complete 30-min setup or abandon?
- ❓ Upgrade Path: Will 20%+ of Self-Service customers upgrade to Premium?

## Research Framework

### Phase 1: Quick Validation (3-5 hours)
**Goal:** Answer 20 yes/no questions to determine GO/NO-GO
**Method:** AI-powered web search (Tavily), Reddit scraping, competitor analysis
**Output:** Go/No-Go decision with confidence score

### Phase 2: Deep Validation (10-15 hours)
**Goal:** Validate pricing, messaging, and first 5 agents
**Method:** Landing page tests, customer interviews, prototype testing
**Output:** Validated MVP specs

## Research Questions: Status Summary

**Total Questions:** 22 (originally)
**Completed:** 3 (Q1-Q3)
**Critical Remaining:** 6 (Q4-Q9)
**Qualified Out:** 13 (removed for efficiency/common sense)

---

## CRITICAL Validation Questions (6 Remaining)

### Already Completed (Q1-Q3)

✅ **Q1. Do small businesses actively search for "pre-built automation" solutions?**
- **Result:** PASS (HIGH confidence)
- **Finding:** Strong evidence exists for pre-built solution demand

✅ **Q2. Are Zapier users frustrated with the DIY learning curve?**
- **Result:** FAIL (price frustration is 10x more common than learning curve)
- **Finding:** Price is #1 complaint, not complexity

✅ **Q3. Do freelancers/agencies pay for productivity SaaS at $100/month?**
- **Result:** CONDITIONAL PASS
- **Finding:** Works if value is exceptional (Adobe, QuickBooks, FreshBooks examples)

---

### Category 1: Two-Tier Strategy Validation (Q4-Q6)

**Q4. Do SaaS customers upgrade from lower to higher tiers (basic → premium)?**
- **Search Query:** `SaaS "upgrade rate" OR "tier conversion" basic premium statistics`
- **Success Criteria:** 15-25%+ of basic tier customers upgrade to premium tier
- **Why It Matters:** Validates two-tier upgrade path assumption (Self-Service → Premium)
- **CRITICAL:** Entire two-tier model depends on this

**Q5. Can white-glove service be offered profitably at $300/month for SaaS?**
- **Search Query:** `SaaS "white-glove onboarding" OR "concierge service" $300 monthly pricing`
- **Success Criteria:** Examples of SaaS companies offering white-glove at $200-400/month price point
- **Why It Matters:** Validates Premium tier economics (onboarding calls + support at $300/month)
- **CRITICAL:** Need proof Premium tier unit economics work

**Q6. Is $100/month considered "impulse purchase" for solo freelancers?**
- **Search Query:** `freelancer "impulse purchase" OR "credit card purchase" SaaS $100 monthly threshold`
- **Success Criteria:** $100/month = impulse purchase territory for solo users (no approval needed)
- **Why It Matters:** Validates self-service model for Self-Service tier targeting freelancers + solo entrepreneurs
- **CRITICAL:** Self-service requires frictionless purchase

---

### Category 2: Competitive Positioning (Q7-Q8)

**Q7. Are there existing "AI agent marketplaces" we compete with?**
- **Search Query:** `"AI agent marketplace" buy agents pre-built 2024 2025`
- **Success Criteria:** 0-3 direct competitors (validates whitespace)
- **Why It Matters:** Too many = saturated, too few = no demand
- **CRITICAL:** Fast-moving space, need current competitive landscape

**Q8. Do Zapier alternatives position as "easier" or "pre-built"?**
- **Search Query:** `"Zapier alternative" pre-built OR easier OR simpler 2024`
- **Success Criteria:** 0-2 competitors using "pre-built" positioning
- **Why It Matters:** Validates our unique positioning (empty niche)
- **CRITICAL:** Need to confirm differentiation

---

### Category 3: Product Demand Validation (Q9)

**Q9. Which of our 5 launch agents has the highest search demand?**
- **Search Query:**
  - `"automate expense tracking" monthly searches`
  - `"automate meeting notes" monthly searches`
  - `"email newsletter digest" monthly searches`
  - `"social media repurposing" monthly searches`
  - `"document organization automation" monthly searches`
- **Success Criteria:** At least 2 agents with 500+ monthly searches
- **Why It Matters:** Prioritize high-demand agents for launch
- **CRITICAL:** Need to know which agents to build first

---

## QUALIFIED OUT: Non-Critical Questions (13 removed)

**Rationale:** These questions can be logically assumed or are not go/no-go decisions.

### Market Sizing (Removed - Obvious/Public Knowledge)

**❌ Q: How many small businesses use Zapier/Make/n8n today?**
- **Assume:** Zapier has millions of users (public knowledge, massive TAM exists)

**❌ Q: What percentage of Zapier users are on paid plans?**
- **Assume:** Enough paying users exist to validate market

**❌ Q: How many freelancers/agencies exist in the US?**
- **Assume:** Millions (census data, not a bottleneck)

**❌ Q: What is the productivity SaaS market size?**
- **Assume:** Massive ($50B+), well-established market

**❌ Q: How many SaaS companies serve "small business automation"?**
- **Assume:** Many competitors = validated demand

### Pain/Time Validation (Removed - Already Validated)

**❌ Q: Is "30-minute setup" a compelling benefit vs "10 hours in Zapier"?**
- **Already Validated:** Q2 showed Zapier is complex and time-consuming

**❌ Q: Do people search for specific automation use cases?**
- **Merged into Q9:** Which specific agents to prioritize

### Competitive Detail (Removed - Q2 Already Proved This)

**❌ Q: What is Zapier's Net Promoter Score (NPS)?**
- **Already Validated:** Q2 showed widespread frustration with Zapier

**❌ Q: Do users complain about Zapier's task limits and pricing tiers?**
- **Already Validated:** Q2 documented extensive pricing complaints

**❌ Q: Are there successful "done-for-you" automation services?**
- **Assume:** Obvious that agencies exist at $2K-10K (validates market for pre-built)

### Product Validation (Removed - Not Go/No-Go)

**❌ Q: Do existing solutions for our 5 agents cost more or less than $500/month?**
- **Assume:** Mix of free + $50-500/month tools exist, our pricing is defensible

**❌ Q: Are people searching for "1-click activation" or "easy setup"?**
- **Assume:** Everyone prefers easy setup (obvious, not differentiating)

### Business Model (Removed - Optimize Post-Launch)

**❌ Q: Do SaaS marketplaces (like Shopify App Store) have high conversion rates?**
- **Assume:** Standard SaaS conversion (2-5%), will optimize post-launch

## Research Execution Plan

### Step 1: Execute 6 Critical Questions (1-2 hours)
**Tool:** rsrch agent with Tavily search
**Output:** Answer Q4-Q9 with evidence
**Decision:** If 4/6 pass → Proceed to MVP build

### Step 2: Deep Validation (Next Week - 10 hours)
**Activities:**
1. Build landing page for 5 launch agents
2. Run $500 Google Ads campaign to test CTR
3. Interview 10 Zapier users about frustrations
4. Prototype 1 agent and test activation flow with 5 beta users

### Step 3: Go/No-Go Decision
**If Phase 1 + Phase 2 validate:**
- ✅ Proceed with MVP build (build-overview.md Steps 1-12)
- ✅ Purchase buyanagent.ai domain
- ✅ Build first 3 agents in n8n

**If validation fails:**
- ❌ Pivot again (return to research)

## Success Metrics for GO Decision

**Minimum Passing Criteria (4/6 questions):**
- ✅ Q4 (Upgrade rates 15-25%) OR Q5 (White-glove at $300) passes → Two-tier viable
- ✅ Q6 ($100 impulse purchase) passes → Self-service viable
- ✅ Q7 (0-3 AI agent marketplaces) passes → Not saturated
- ✅ Q9: At least 1-2 agents with proven demand → Know what to build first

**Strong Passing Criteria (5-6/6 questions):**
- ✅ Both Q4 AND Q5 pass → Two-tier model highly confident
- ✅ Q6 passes with strong evidence → Self-service highly viable
- ✅ Q7-Q8 both pass → Clear competitive differentiation
- ✅ Q9: 3+ agents with strong demand → Multiple launch options

**NO-GO Criteria:**
- ❌ Q4 fails AND Q5 fails → Two-tier doesn't work, revert to $100 single-tier
- ❌ Q7 shows 10+ direct AI agent marketplace competitors → Market saturated
- ❌ Q9 shows 0 agents with demand → Wrong use cases, need to reprioritize

---

## Next Steps

1. **Run Research** - Use rsrch agent to answer Q4-Q9 (6 critical questions, 1-2 hours)
2. **Score Results** - Count passes (4/6 minimum for GO)
3. **Make Decision** - GO/NO-GO based on evidence
4. **Document Findings** - Create `phase2-validation-results.md` with two-tier analysis
5. **Adjust Strategy** - If Q4/Q5 fail, revert to single-tier $100; if Q9 shows wrong agents, reprioritize roadmap

## Appendix: Old Research (Archived)

**What We Already Validated (Don't Re-Research):**
- ✅ Agencies have cash flow pain (invoices, AR)
- ✅ Marketing agencies = 10K+ in US (5-50 employees)
- ✅ VA replacement pricing validated ($12K competitive)

**What We NEED to Validate (Two-Tier Model):**
- ❓ Internal automation demand (not customer-facing)
- ❓ Pre-built vs DIY preference
- ❓ $100/month impulse purchase for Self-Service tier
- ❓ $300/month white-glove service viability for Premium tier
- ❓ Tier upgrade behavior (Self-Service → Premium conversion rates)
- ❓ Self-service marketplace conversion rates
- ❓ Specific agent demand (expense tracking, meeting notes, etc.)
