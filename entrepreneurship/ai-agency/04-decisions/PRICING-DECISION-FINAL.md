## Why Two Tiers (vs Uniform Pricing)

### Previous Approach (October 5, 2025)

**Uniform $100/month for all agents**
- Invoice Reminder - $100/month
- Lead Qualification - $100/month

**Problems:**
- ❌ Market won't pay $100 for email management (Clean Email = $10)
- ❌ No differentiation between simple vs complex agents
- ❌ High barrier to entry (no impulse purchase option)
- ❌ Limited to service businesses (narrow market)

### New Approach (October 6, 2025)

**Value-Based Tiered Pricing**
- Utility tier = $29-79 (invisible automation, status pages)
- Premium tier = $100-150 (dashboard intelligence, analytics)

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Market-appropriate pricing (compete with $5-20 tools AND $200-600 platforms)
- ✅ Clear differentiation (status page = Utility, dashboard = Premium)
- ✅ Multiple entry points ($29 impulse → $150 ROI-driven)
- ✅ Broader market (20M+ businesses vs 5M service businesses)

## Pricing Philosophy

**Value-Based Pricing** (not cost-based)
- Price = % of value delivered to customer
- Utility tier = 7-20% of time savings value
- Premium tier = 2-8% of business impact value

**Interface = Tier Signal**
- Status page = Utility tier (invisible automation)
- Dashboard = Premium tier (business intelligence)
