# MVP Agent Selection: Final Decision

**Decision Date:** October 6, 2025 (Tiered Strategy Update)
**Status:** FINAL - Ready to Build
**Strategic Shift:** 2-agent uniform pricing → 5-agent tiered model

---

## Executive Summary

**MVP Agents (Tiered Model):**

**Utility Tier** (Invisible Automation - $29-79/month):
1. **Email Sweeper** - $29-39/month (unsubscribe + delete + archive automation)
2. **Newsletter Digester** - $49-59/month (AI summarization of subscriptions)
3. **Expense Manager** - $69-79/month (receipt scanning + auto-categorization)

**Premium Tier** (Business Intelligence - $100-150/month):
4. **Invoice Chaser** - $100/month (payment reminders + DSO analytics dashboard)
5. **Lead Qualification** - $100-150/month (AI scoring + enrichment + pipeline dashboard)

**Strategic Rationale:**
- **Tiered pricing** = Broader market access (Utility tier captures 20M+ businesses vs 5M service businesses)
- **De-risked MVP** = 5 agents across 2 tiers vs 2 agents in single tier
- **Value-based pricing** = Invisible automation ($29-79) ≠ dashboard intelligence ($100-150)
- **Multiple entry points** = Email Sweeper ($29 impulse buy) vs Invoice Chaser ($100 analytical purchase)
- **Phased rollout** = Utility tier first (Weeks 1-5), Premium tier second (Weeks 6-10)

## Why We Pivoted from 2-Agent to 5-Agent Tiered Strategy

### **Previous Plan (October 5, 2025)**

**2 Agents at Uniform $100/month:**
1. Invoice Reminder (Priority 1) - $100/month
2. Lead Qualification (Priority 2) - $100/month

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ Narrow market (only 5-8M service businesses with invoicing/leads)
- ❌ High barrier to entry ($100 = analytical purchase, not impulse)
- ❌ Single point of failure (if both agents fail, MVP fails)
- ❌ Competing directly with $200-600 enterprise tools (Clearbit, Bonsai, HoneyBook)

### **New Plan (October 6, 2025)**

**5 Agents in Two Tiers ($29-150/month):**
- 3 Utility tier agents (Email, Newsletter, Expense) - $29-79/month
- 2 Premium tier agents (Invoice, Lead) - $100-150/month

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Broader market (20M+ businesses use email/expenses daily)
- ✅ Lower barrier to entry ($29-39 Email Sweeper = impulse purchase)
- ✅ De-risked portfolio (5 agents = multiple paths to product-market fit)
- ✅ Value-based pricing (compete with $5-20 tools on Utility, $200-600 on Premium)
- ✅ Clear differentiation (Utility = invisible automation, Premium = dashboard intelligence)

## Agent Selection Rationale

### **Utility Tier Agents** (Set It and Forget It)

#### 1. Email Sweeper ($29-39/month)

**Why This Agent:**
- **Broadest market appeal** - Everyone has email noise (20M+ businesses)
- **Lowest barrier to entry** - $29-39 = impulse purchase vs $100 analytical decision
- **Proven market** - Clean Email (500K users), SaneBox (300K users), Leave Me Alone (100K users)
- **Simple value prop** - "Inbox from 200 unread → 15 important emails"
- **Fast activation** - 15-min setup, immediate value

**Competitive Positioning:**
- vs Clean Email ($10), SaneBox ($7), Leave Me Alone ($19)
- **Our differentiation:** AI-powered (vs rule-based) + combined unsubscribe/delete/archive (vs separate tools)
- **Price justification:** 2-3x competitors BUT 10x smarter automation

**Market Gap:**
- No AI-powered solution combining unsubscribe + delete + archive in single tool
- Competitors focus on single feature (unsubscribe OR inbox zero, not both)

#### 2. Newsletter Digester ($49-59/month)

**Why This Agent:**
- **High pain point** - "I subscribe to 20 newsletters but only read 2"
- **Proven demand** - Unroll.me (1M+ users), Substack app (1M+ installs)
- **AI differentiation** - GPT-4 summarization (3-5 key points) vs simple digest
- **Cross-platform value** - Works with Substack, Beehiiv, Medium, custom newsletters

**Competitive Positioning:**
- vs Unroll.me (Free/$5 - no AI), Substack app (free - Substack only)
- **Our differentiation:** AI summarization + cross-platform + single daily email
- **Price justification:** 10x Unroll.me BUT delivers AI-extracted insights, not just organization

**Market Gap:**
- AI-powered newsletter summarization doesn't exist at consumer price point
- Substack app limited to Substack only (no Beehiiv, Medium, custom newsletters)

#### 3. Expense Manager ($69-79/month)

**Why This Agent:**
- **Universal business need** - All businesses track expenses (20M+ potential customers)
- **High time savings** - 2 hours/week → 0 hours/week (100% automation)
- **Proven market** - Expensify (10M users), QuickBooks Self-Employed (2M users)
- **Tax season value** - Never miss a deductible receipt

**Competitive Positioning:**
- vs Expensify Lite ($5), QuickBooks Self-Employed ($20), Shoeboxed ($18-36)
- **Our differentiation:** AI extraction + Google Sheets (vs proprietary apps) + zero manual entry
- **Price justification:** 3-4x Expensify BUT fully automated AI categorization

**Market Gap:**
- AI-powered receipt extraction at low price point (Expensify AI = $20+/month)
- Google Sheets integration (vs forcing users into proprietary accounting software)

---

### **Premium Tier Agents** (Dashboard + Business Intelligence)

#### 4. Invoice Chaser ($100/month)

**Why This Agent:**
- **Business-critical pain** - Cash flow = business survival
- **Measurable ROI** - Get paid 17 days faster (DSO: 45 → 28 days)
- **Strong demand** - 19 Reddit requests, Zapier #6 workflow (1.1M+ installs)
- **Dashboard justifies price** - DSO trends, payment velocity, client behavior analytics

**Competitive Positioning:**
- vs Bonsai ($25-50), HoneyBook ($40-80), Dubsado ($35-75)
- **Our differentiation:** Standalone agent (not bloated platform) + AI escalation + DSO dashboard
- **Price justification:** 2-3x Bonsai BUT no CRM bloat + intelligent analytics

**Market Validation:**
- 19 explicit Reddit requests: "I spend 4 hours/week chasing invoices"
- Zapier #6 most installed workflow (1.1M+ installations)
- n8n #5 popular workflow (612 clones)
- Proven willingness to pay (Bonsai, HoneyBook, Dubsado built $10M+ businesses on this)

#### 5. Lead Qualification ($100-150/month)

**Why This Agent:**
- **High-value time savings** - 5 hours/week saved on manual lead research
- **Sales efficiency** - 30%+ close rate improvement (focus on qualified prospects)
- **Low competition** - Only 2-3 specialized tools (vs 10+ CRM basic filters)
- **Dashboard intelligence** - Lead pipeline, scoring breakdown, conversion metrics

**Competitive Positioning:**
- vs Clearbit ($200+), MadKudu ($300+), Zapier/Make (10+ hours to build)
- **Our differentiation:** AI scoring + transparent breakdown + full dashboard (vs API-only)
- **Price justification:** 50% less than Clearbit BUT includes dashboard + AI intelligence

**Market Validation:**
- 16 explicit Reddit requests: "Need AI to qualify leads before I waste time"
- Low competition (only Clearbit, MadKudu at enterprise pricing)
- High-value use case (sales time = most expensive resource)
- Complements Invoice Chaser (lead → qualify → win → invoice → get paid)

## Tier Classification Decision

### **Why Utility vs Premium Tiers?**

**Naming Rationale:**
- **"Utility"** = Essential, invisible, commodity service (like electricity - you use it but don't think about it)
- **"Premium"** = High-value, intelligent, decision-support (dashboard = command center)

**Interface Decision:**
- **Utility tier** = Simple status page (health + activity metrics)
  - Example: "Email Sweeper - Status: ✓ Running, 47 emails processed today"
  - Rationale: Invisible automation doesn't need complex dashboard
- **Premium tier** = Full analytics dashboard (charts, trends, controls)
  - Example: "Invoice Chaser - DSO: 28 days (37% improvement), $12.4K cash flow impact"
  - Rationale: Business intelligence = dashboard justifies premium price

**Service Delivery:**
- **Both tiers:** n8n Cloud workflows (invisible background processing)
- **Utility tier:** Results appear in existing tools (Gmail, Sheets, Slack) + minimal status page
- **Premium tier:** Results + analytics dashboard on buyanagent.ai

## Build Roadmap (Phased Rollout)

### **Phase 1A: Utility Tier Validation (Weeks 1-4)**

**Build:** Expense Manager + Newsletter Digester
- **Goal:** Prove "invisible automation" concept, validate $49-79 pricing
- **Outcome:** 30-50 customers, feedback on status page UX
- **Why these two first:** Universal business needs, fastest builds (1-2 weeks each)

### **Phase 1B: Utility Tier Completion (Week 5)**

**Build:** Email Sweeper
- **Goal:** Complete Utility tier portfolio (3 agents)
- **Outcome:** Test multi-agent adoption (2-3 agents per customer)
- **Why:** Lowest price point ($29-39) = broadest appeal for final Utility agent

### **Phase 2: Premium Tier Launch (Weeks 6-10)**

**Build:** Invoice Chaser + Lead Qualification (with full dashboards)
- **Goal:** Prove "business intelligence" value prop, validate $100-150 pricing
- **Outcome:** 50+ Premium tier customers, dashboard analytics feedback
- **Why:** Dashboards take longer (3-4 weeks each), need Utility tier traction first

**Total Timeline:** 10 weeks to full 5-agent MVP

---

## Revenue Impact Analysis

### **Year 1 Comparison: 2-Agent vs 5-Agent Strategy**

**Old Strategy (2 Agents at $100/month):**
- 100 customers × $200/month (2 agents avg) = $20K MRR = $240K ARR
- **Risk:** Narrow market (service businesses only), high barrier ($100 entry)

**New Strategy (5 Agents, Tiered $29-150/month):**
- 150 Utility tier customers (avg 2 agents @ $60/mo) = $18K MRR
- 100 Premium tier customers (avg 1.5 agents @ $115/mo) = $17.25K MRR
- **Total: $35K MRR = $420K ARR** (+75% vs old strategy)

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Broader market (20M+ vs 5-8M potential customers)
- ✅ Lower CAC (Email Sweeper $29 impulse buy vs Invoice $100 analytical purchase)
- ✅ De-risked (5 agents = multiple paths to PMF)
- ✅ Higher revenue potential (+$180K ARR Year 1)

## Customer Segmentation Placeholder

**[TBD - Customer profiles and segments under development]**

**Core Targeting Principles:**
- Businesses **without AI or high-end dev talent** on staff
- Should **feel targeted and specific** but actually be **broad** in appeal
- Multiple entry points across Utility and Premium tiers

**Detailed segmentation framework to be developed post-approval of tiered strategy.**

---

## Questions Resolved

### **Q: Why not launch all 5 agents simultaneously?**
**A:** Phased rollout de-risks build, allows pricing validation per tier, and creates momentum (launch Utility tier, get traction, then launch Premium tier with "now with dashboards" messaging)

### **Q: Why not keep $100 uniform pricing for simplicity?**
**A:** Market won't pay $100 for email management when Clean Email = $10. Value-based pricing matches willingness-to-pay (invisible automation ≠ dashboard intelligence).

### **Q: Why Email Sweeper at $29-39 vs higher price?**
**A:** Lowest barrier to entry = broadest market access. Email Sweeper is trojan horse (low-cost entry → upsell to Newsletter $49 → Expense $79 → Invoice $100).

### **Q: Why dashboards only for Premium tier?**
**A:** Dashboard development = 2-3 weeks extra per agent. Utility tier doesn't need dashboards (invisible automation = "set and forget"). Premium tier dashboard justifies 3-4x price premium.

### **Q: Should we offer bundles at launch?**
**A:** No. Validate individual agent pricing first. Bundle strategy deferred to post-MVP after customer feedback on which agents they combine.
