## The 5 Content Pillars

### Pillar 1: Automation Wins (30% of content)

**Core Message:** "Real results from real customers"

**Content Types:**
1. **Before/After Transformations**
   - DSO: 45 days → 28 days (37% improvement)
   - Time saved: 4 hrs/week → 30 min/week
   - Cost reduction: $800/month in late fees eliminated

2. **Customer Case Studies**
   - Anonymized metrics with permission
   - Industry-specific wins (agency vs freelancer vs SaaS founder)
   - Multi-agent success stories (3 agents = 10 hrs/week saved)

3. **Dashboard Screenshots**
   - Invoice Chaser analytics (payment velocity trends)
   - Lead Qualification pipeline (conversion funnel)
   - Expense Manager summary (monthly spend by category)

**Platform Mix:**
- **LinkedIn:** 40% (professional case studies with carousels)
- **Twitter:** 30% (metric-heavy threads)
- **Threads:** 30% (visual dashboard screenshots)

**Example Posts:**
```
LinkedIn:
"17 days faster payment. Here's the exact Invoice Chaser workflow:

[5-slide carousel showing email escalation sequence + DSO dashboard]

Customer: Marketing agency with 40 clients
Problem: Average payment time 45 days (cash flow crisis)
Solution: Invoice Chaser automation ($100/mo)
Result: 28-day average DSO, $12K freed up in Q1

Not a case study. This is running live right now."

Twitter:
"Agency owner just sent me this:

'Your Invoice Chaser saved my business. I was 2 weeks from shutting down. Now clients pay in 28 days instead of 45.'

$100/month agent. $12,000 cash flow impact.

This is why AI agents > bloated platforms."

Threads:

"This graph saved a business.

45 days to 28 days average payment time.

One agent. $100/month. Zero manual work.

This is what good automation looks like."
```

**When to Use:**
- Have fresh customer win with metrics
- Need social proof content
- Conversion-stage content (move followers to customers)

---

### Pillar 2: Anti-Bloat Philosophy (20% of content)

**Core Message:** "You don't need 90% of SaaS features. You need the 10% that works."

**Content Types:**
1. **Platform Callouts** (Respectful but Direct)
   - "Zapier charges $600/mo for workflows you build yourself. We charge $100 for pre-built + maintained."
   - "Bonsai has 47 features. You use 3. We sell those 3 for less."

2. **Feature Bloat Breakdowns**
   - Analyze competitor pricing tiers
   - Show unused features (dark patterns)
   - Advocate for unbundling

3. **Standalone Agent Philosophy**
   - Why you don't need an "all-in-one platform"
   - Mix-and-match agents vs locked-in ecosystems
   - Pay for value, not feature count

**Platform Mix:**
- **LinkedIn:** 30% (professional critiques with data)
- **Twitter:** 50% (hot takes, controversy drives engagement)
- **Threads:** 20% (casual observations)

**Example Posts:**
```
LinkedIn:
"Analyzed Bonsai's $40/month plan.

47 features listed.
12 require add-ons.
8 are just glorified templates.

The only features freelancers actually use:
- Invoice reminders
- Payment tracking
- Client management

We sell the first two for $100/mo.
No bloat. No upsells. Just what works.

This is the future of SaaS."

Twitter:
"Hot take:

SaaS platforms are dying because they optimized for feature count, not value.

You don't need 50 integrations.
You need 3 that work perfectly.

Standalone AI agents > bloated platforms.

This is the unbundling."

Threads:
"Why does every productivity app need a dashboard, a mobile app, and a Chrome extension?

Sometimes you just need an agent that works invisibly.

Email Sweeper runs in the background. No UI. No login.

That's the point."
```

**When to Use:**
- Competitor launches overpriced/bloated feature
- Community complains about platform complexity
- Need engagement bait (controversy)

---

### Pillar 3: Founder Transparency (20% of content)

**Core Message:** "Building in public - wins, losses, lessons"

**Content Types:**
1. **Revenue Milestones**
   - "$10K MRR hit - here's what worked"
   - "First 100 customers - breakdown by agent"
   - "Churn analysis: Why 12% cancelled (and what we're fixing)"

2. **Build Logs**
   - "Built Newsletter Digester in 2 weeks using n8n - here's the workflow"
   - "This agent flopped. Shutting it down. Here's why."
   - "Customer requested X feature. Built it in 3 days. Here's how."

3. **Behind-the-Scenes**
   - n8n workflow screenshots (show the automation)
   - GPT-4 prompt engineering (how we generate content)
   - Customer feedback threads (raw, unfiltered)

**Platform Mix:**
- **LinkedIn:** 35% (professional founder journey)
- **Twitter:** 35% (rapid-fire updates, raw thoughts)
- **Threads:** 30% (casual BTS content)

**Example Posts:**
```
LinkedIn:
"Hit $10K MRR this week. Here's the breakdown:

- Invoice Chaser: $4,200 (42 customers × $100)
- Lead Qualification: $3,750 (25 customers × $150)
- Expense Manager: $1,580 (20 customers × $79)
- Newsletter Digester: $470 (8 customers × $59)

Lessons learned:
1. Premium tier agents (dashboards) = higher retention
2. Utility tier agents = faster growth but more churn
3. Multi-agent customers = 3x lifetime value

Building in public. More updates weekly."

Twitter:
"Killed the 'Social Media Scheduler' agent today.

8 activations in 6 weeks. 6 cancelled within 30 days.

Why it failed:
- Buffer/Hootsuite already cheap
- No AI differentiation
- We built what we thought was cool, not what customers needed

Lesson: Solve real pain, not imagined use cases."

Threads:
"This is the n8n workflow that generates our social content.

[Screenshot of workflow nodes]

GPT-4 → Airtable → Slack approval → Multi-platform posting → Engagement tracking

We use AI agents to market AI agents.

Meta, but it works."
```

**When to Use:**
- Hit milestone (revenue, customer count, product launch)
- Learn hard lesson (failure, churn spike, mistake)
- Want to build community trust (transparency = credibility)

---

### Pillar 4: AI Practicality (20% of content)

**Core Message:** "No hype. No AGI predictions. Just what AI can do for you today."

**Content Types:**
1. **AI Education** (Demystifying)
   - "How GPT-4 extracts invoice data from PDFs (plain English)"
   - "Why AI categorization beats rule-based filters (example)"
   - "The 3 places AI actually saves time vs hype"

2. **Prompt Engineering Snippets**
   - "Here's the exact prompt that scores leads 0-100"
   - "How we get GPT-4 to write escalating invoice emails"
   - "The 5-word prompt that categorizes 200 expenses/week"

3. **AI Limitations** (Honesty)
   - "AI can't replace human judgment on $10K+ invoices (why we flag for approval)"
   - "When automation fails: Edge cases we handle manually"
   - "The 20% of tasks AI still can't do well"

**Platform Mix:**
- **LinkedIn:** 40% (professional AI education)
- **Twitter:** 35% (quick tactical tips)
- **Threads:** 25% (casual AI observations)

**Example Posts:**
```
LinkedIn:
"How GPT-4 scores leads 0-100 (plain English breakdown):

Input:
- Company size (10-500 employees)
- Job title (decision maker or not?)
- Email content (budget signals, intent keywords)
- Industry match (target vertical or not?)

GPT-4 prompt:
'Analyze this lead. Score 0-100 based on: company size (25%), budget signals (20%), job title (20%), industry (15%), geography (10%), tech stack (10%). Explain reasoning.'

Output:
Score: 85/100
Reasoning:
✓ 180 employees (+25)
✓ 'Enterprise plan' in email (+20)
✓ VP of Sales (decision maker) (+20)
✓ SaaS industry (target) (+15)
⚠ International (-5)

No black box. Full transparency."

Twitter:
"AI prompt tip:

Instead of:
'Categorize this expense'

Use:
'Categorize this expense: Travel, Meals, Office Supplies, Software, or Other. If uncertain, choose Other.'

Specificity = better results.

This works for GPT-4, Claude, Gemini."

Threads:
"AI can't replace human judgment.

Our Invoice Chaser flags invoices >$5K for manual approval.

Why? Because a $10K client relationship is worth more than automation efficiency.

Good AI knows its limits."
```

**When to Use:**
- Customer asks "How does this actually work?"
- Combat AI hype with practical examples
- Educational content (awareness stage)

---

### Pillar 5: Small Business Empowerment (10% of content)

How?

3 AI agents:
- Lead Qualification (scores 100+ leads/week)
- Invoice Chaser (gets paid 20 days faster)
- Expense Manager (never touches receipts)

Total cost: $329/month
Time saved: 12 hours/week

Small teams with smart tools beat big teams with bloat."

Twitter:
"You don't need:
- Salesforce ($200/mo)
- HubSpot ($500/mo)
- Bonsai ($50/mo)
- Expensify ($20/mo)

You need:
- Lead agent ($150)
- Invoice agent ($100)
- Expense agent ($79)

$329 total.
Zero bloat.
Actually works."

Threads:
"Freed up 10 hours this week by automating:
- Email noise filtering
- Expense tracking
- Invoice reminders

Spent the time:
- Playing guitar
- Reading fiction
- Hanging with my kids

Automation isn't about working more.
It's about living better."
```

**When to Use:**
