## üìã Design System Reference

All pages use consistent design system. See any prompt file for full specifications.

### Core Design Principles

1. **Approachable** - Not intimidating (unlike developer tools)
2. **Fast** - Instant clarity on what each agent does
3. **Trustworthy** - Social proof, clear pricing, no hidden fees
4. **Delightful** - Smooth animations, micro-interactions

### Brand Identity

**Colors:**
- Background: Navy-black (#0B0E13) with 2% noise texture
- Primary: Indigo gradient (#4F46E5 to #3730A3)
- Text: Off-white (#F9FAFB) primary, subtle gray hierarchy
- Cards: Elevated dark (#161B22)
- Feedback: Green (#10B981), Red (#EF4444), Amber (#F59E0B)

**Typography:**
- Font: Inter (clean, modern sans-serif)
- Headlines: Bold, 32-48px, #F9FAFB
- Body: Regular, 16-18px, #E5E7EB
- Labels: Medium, 14px, #D1D5DB

**Icons:**
- Set: Heroicons only (NO emojis)
- Agent icons: Heroicon glyphs (EnvelopeIcon, CurrencyDollarIcon, etc.)
- Colors: White for nav, Indigo for CTAs

**Vibe:**
- "Underground marketplace with tech legitimacy" - dark, exclusive, sophisticated
- NOT: "Shopify meets Stripe" (that's light mode thinking)
- Think: Premium developer tool meets secret club
