## Timeline
### 2025-01-21 — Recruiting Discussion
- Summary:
  - **Market Context**: Current MBAs report market is extremely tough, need to be highly premeditated and seek pre-MBA experience demonstrating "re-commitment" to field
  - **Current Activities**: Interviewing with a firm for open MBA role; Blackstone Tac Opps checks boxes as ideal landing spot; Connected with HBS alum at 26 North who offered intro to recruiter
  - **John Watson Conversation Prep**:
    - **Positioning**: Spent time on both Sports and Keystone at Arctos
    - **Key learning**: Competitive advantage in markets with high conviction and structural undersupply of capital
    - **Themes approach**: Thinking through big themes/trends to inform investment decisions
    - **Wholistic thinking**: Recognizing diminishing marginal returns to sports asset class as capital floods in
    - **Appeal of Tac Opps**: Unconstrained, flexibility appeals after being asset class specific
  - **Key Advice**: 
    - David Blitzer video on Tac Opps - Blackstone as thematic investor [get from Alastair]
    - Question for John: "In world where you're unconstrained, how do you minimize distraction risk?"
    - Focus on relationship-building first, make asks afterward
    - Note: Alastair doesn't like Josh Harris - "ruthless and solely devoted to winning"

### 2024-08-16 — Career Strategy Discussion
- Summary:
  - **Investment Philosophy**: Looking for investment style with downside protection and asymmetric upside returns; Focus on value-creating direct investor, not trader; Avoid mentioning secondaries (unsexy) and "structured" (implies debt/mezzanine); Lean into operating experience/value creation lens
  - **Competitive Landscape**: Firms competing with Blackstone in Tac Opps: Oaktree, CVC, EQT, maybe KKR
  - **MBA Positioning**: MBA gives aperture to discover and pursue true desires
  - PD Soros fellowship rec request (10/31 deadline)
