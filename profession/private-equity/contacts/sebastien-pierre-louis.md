## Timeline
### 2025-10-13 — Initial Conversation at Sofra Bakery
- Summary:
  - Met alongside Hunter (HBS '26, formerly Veritas Capital, pursuing search)
  - Discussed two career paths:
    - **Megafund path:** PE, especially within buyout, is a grind even at the VP level. Maybe only 1 out of 10 VPs hired will be "pulled up" the ranks on a path to partner. Realistically, any firm that is procedurally hiring on campus for VP positions every year is having commensurate churn among ranks of middle management in PE - highly likely, but not a given, that those firms don't inherently value long-term talent and sponsorship at this level. That said, going to one of these firms can certainly unlock compelling optionality - either after a summer or after 2-3 years full time. So there are still merits here even assuming there won't be sponsorship up the ladder. Also, these funds can compensate very well, even though that shouldn't be the primary decision criterion. The path to these opportunities is typically formulaic: they will push opportunities through 12twenty and interviews will begin in January. There will be get-to-know-you events throughout the fall for which recruiters will be formulating their shortlists for candidates and interviewing people informally. It's important to stay on top of those dates and remain prepared to hop in a process at any time, if you want to make the most of those opportunities
    - **Bespoke path:** Sebastien gave the example of his current situation at BDT & MSD Partners, where he has been for some years and has deep rapport with the team. He is working on constructing a fund strategy in partnership with one of the firm's partners and a principal. That is a special position to be in because he will be in the position to take some "market share" of the firm's strategic advantage and he will help shape the future of the firm. Finding something like that would be a really valuable use of the optionality and reach afforded by the HBS degree. Finding something like this is much more entrepreneurial. There might not be a standardized process at all. Gotta search for opportunities, pay very close attention, speak to people, build community and find opportunities where I can apply my distinct competencies and competitive advantages and then pitch the partners on getting me on board in their project
  - **Most salient takeaway from Sebastien:** Someone of my caliber should not let my talent go to waste parked at a large firm that doesn't want to invest in me as a long-term owner and contributor to the investment franchise. I DO NOT need validation or to prove that I can "do the work" - don't get blinded by that insecurity, as so many at HBS do. There have been people at HBS who have pursued a non-traditional path and found really great success, tons of purpose and meaning, as well as career development that surpasses that of their peers
  - **My reflection:** Finding an "Arctos pre-Fund I close" - an emerging manager that is looking to take a risk on me because I'm taking a risk on them. A place where I can occupy some meaningful "market share" of the thought leadership and innovation. Either a young fund or a nascent strategy within a larger fund - this should be my primary search criteria. Megafund buyout or special situations should be the plan B
