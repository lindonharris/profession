    "greeting": "Good morning Jahan,",
    "paragraph_1": "My name is LinDon Harris. I'm sending this note to express my strong interest in the 2026 MBA Summer Associate position with the External Investing Group at Goldman Sachs. By way of background, I am a current MBA candidate at Harvard Business School with five years of financial services experience spanning structured credit at Morgan Stanley ($21B+ in closed deals), private equity at Arctos Partners ($230M+ deployed), and most recently asset-backed finance at startup Inspiration Mobility (managing a $60M commercial lease portfolio).",
    "paragraph_2": "At Arctos, I worked on a research team tasked with conducting the data analysis needed to lay the groundwork for a new Arctos fund strategy dedicated to liquidity solutions and growth capital for alternative asset managers. I found the work to be absolutely fascinating and it sparked an interest in GP stakes investing. I've since had the fortune to connect with Ned Wang on the Petershill team, who has inspired me to pursue this work post-MBA.",
    "paragraph_3": "Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to connecting. I have also submitted my application via the Goldman Sachs careers portal.",
    "closing": "Regards,\nLinDon",
