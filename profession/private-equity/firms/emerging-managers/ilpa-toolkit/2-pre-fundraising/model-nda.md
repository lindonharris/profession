# ILPA Model Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)

## Overview

The **ILPA Model NDA** provides a standard confidentiality agreement template for use between Limited Partners (LPs) and General Partners (GPs) during fundraising and due diligence.

### Purpose

**Dual Benefits:**

**For General Partners:**
- Protect confidential fund information
- Standardized format reduces negotiation time
- Lower legal costs per LP
- Faster fundraising process

**For Limited Partners:**
- Familiar, vetted structure
- Reduced legal review time
- Lower legal costs
- Faster due diligence process

## Why a Standard NDA Matters

### The Fundraising Bottleneck

**Without Standardization:**
- Each LP sends custom NDA
- GP legal counsel must review each one
- Negotiations on standard terms
- Weeks of back-and-forth
- Delays in receiving diligence materials
- Legal costs multiply

**With ILPA Model NDA:**
- Both parties familiar with terms
- Minimal negotiation needed
- Sign and proceed to diligence
- Hours instead of weeks
- Reduced legal costs

### Industry Efficiency Gain

**At Scale:**
- GP raising from 50 LPs
- 50 custom NDAs = 200+ hours legal time
- 50 ILPA Model NDAs = 20 hours legal time
- **Cost savings: $30,000-50,000 per fund**
- **Time savings: 2-4 weeks**

## Development Process

### Working Group

**Led by:**
Ed Klees, Hirschler Fleischer (Working Group Chair)

**Members Representing:**
- Limited Partners (institutional investors)
- Outsourced CIOs
- General Partner organization
- Legal counsel from both sides

**Represented Organizations:**
- University of Pennsylvania Office of Investments
- California Institute of Technology
- Strategic Investment Group
- Maryland State Retirement Agency
- Mangham Associates, Inc.
- Duke Management Company

- University of Virginia Investment Management Company

**Result:** Balanced document serving both LP and GP interests

## Practical Considerations

### For Emerging Managers

**Pre-Fundraising:**
- [ ] Adopt ILPA Model NDA as standard
- [ ] Have legal counsel review and approve
- [ ] Prepare customization strategy (if needed)
- [ ] Create execution process
- [ ] Train team on confidentiality protocols

**During Fundraising:**
- Send ILPA Model NDA with initial materials
- State upfront: "We use ILPA Model NDA"
- Minimize customizations
- Quick turnaround on execution
- Track NDA status in CRM

**Common Customizations:**

**Minimal Changes Typically Accepted:**
- Governing law (match fund jurisdiction)
- Term duration (2-5 years standard)
- Notice provisions (contact details)
- Counterparty names and details

**Avoid Unnecessary Changes:**
- Don't modify core confidentiality definitions
- Don't restrict reasonable LP disclosures
- Don't add onerous return obligations
- Don't extend duration beyond 5 years

### For LP Due Diligence

**When Receiving ILPA Model NDA:**
- Quick legal review (familiar format)
- Sign within days, not weeks
- Request clarifications if needed
- Proceed to substantive diligence

**When GP Uses Custom NDA:**
- Flag deviations from ILPA Model
- Negotiate back toward standard
- Consider if deviations signal concerns
- Allocate more time for review

## Red Flags in Custom NDAs

### What LPs Watch For

⚠️ **Warning Signs:**

**1. Overly Restrictive Disclosure**
- Prohibits disclosure to investment committee
- Limits advisor engagement
- Restricts compliance/regulatory sharing
- **Concern:** GP controlling information flow

**2. Indefinite Confidentiality**
- No term limitation
- Perpetual obligations
- **Concern:** Unreasonable burden

**3. Onerous Return Requirements**
- Must destroy all notes
- Cannot retain for compliance
- Immediate return demanded
- **Concern:** Impractical for LPs

**4. One-Sided Terms**
- Only LP bound to confidentiality
- GP not reciprocating
- Imbalanced obligations
- **Concern:** Lack of alignment

**5. Unusual Restrictions**
- Can't share with other LPs in fund
- Can't discuss with other prospective LPs
- Can't compare to other managers
- **Concern:** Limits LP due diligence

### Why EMs Sometimes Resist Standard NDA

**Understandable Concerns:**
- First-time fund, nervous about leaks
- Proprietary strategy protection
- Competitive intelligence fears
- Prior experience with breaches

**Counter-Arguments:**
- ILPA Model provides strong protection
- LPs have fiduciary duty to maintain confidentiality
- Reputational risk deters LP breaches
- Overly restrictive NDA slows fundraising
- Standard terms signal professionalism

## Strategic Advantages of Using ILPA Model

### Fundraising Velocity

**Speed to Signature:**
- ILPA Model: 3-7 days average
- Custom NDA: 2-4 weeks average
- **Impact:** 2-3 weeks per LP × 50 LPs = 3-6 months faster fundraise

### Cost Efficiency

**Legal Budget:**
- ILPA Model: $500-1,000 per LP (minimal review)
- Custom NDA: $2,000-5,000 per LP (negotiation)
- **Savings:** $75,000-200,000 per fundraise

### LP Perception

**Signals Sent:**
- Professionalism and industry knowledge
- LP-friendly approach
- Confidence in materials
- Efficient operations
- Alignment with best practices
