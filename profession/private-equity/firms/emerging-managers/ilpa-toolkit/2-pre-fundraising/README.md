## Comparison to Market Alternatives

### ILPA Model NDA vs. Mutual NDA

- LP-favorable terms
- Faster execution
- Less negotiation
- Standard in fundraising

**Mutual NDA:**
- Both parties disclose
- Balanced obligations
- More negotiation required
- Less common in fundraising
- Used in strategic partnerships

### ILPA Model vs. Custom GP NDA

**ILPA Model:**
- Industry standard
- LP-friendly terms
- Quick execution
- Signals transparency

**Custom GP NDA:**
- May be more GP-favorable
- Longer negotiation cycle
- Potential LP concerns
- May signal rigidity

## Emerging Manager Considerations

### Why Use ILPA Model NDA?

**Advantages:**
1. **Speed** - LPs already familiar, quick execution
2. **Credibility** - Signals LP-friendly approach
3. **Cost** - No need for extensive legal review
4. **Consistency** - Same terms for all LPs
5. **Best Practice** - Demonstrates sophistication

**When to Modify:**
- Unusual fund structures (venture, real estate specific terms)
- International fundraising (cross-border considerations)
- Specialized information (proprietary technology, unique IP)

### Common Questions from First-Time GPs

**Q: "Should I use this for all LPs?"**
A: Yes, for consistency and efficiency. Treat all LPs equally.

**Q: "What if an LP wants mutual confidentiality?"**
A: Rare in fundraising. Discuss with legal counsel if it arises.

**Q: "Do I need legal review before using?"**
A: Best practice is yes, but template is GP-ready for standard fundraising.

**Q: "What about international LPs?"**
A: Template works globally. May need addendums for specific jurisdictions.
