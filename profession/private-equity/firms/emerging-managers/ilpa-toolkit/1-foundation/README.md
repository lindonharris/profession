## Common Questions

### "Must every fund follow every Principle?"
No. Principles are aspirational best practices, not mandatory rules. However:
- Institutional LPs increasingly expect alignment
- Deviations should be explained and justified
- Good faith efforts and transparency matter
- Endorsement signals commitment to continuous improvement

### "How do Principles differ from the Model LPA?"
- **Principles**: Philosophy and best practices (what and why)
- **Model LPA**: Legal implementation (how)
- Principles guide, LPA executes

### "Are these legally binding?"
No. Principles are voluntary industry guidance. However:
- Many LPs require adherence in their side letters
- Endorsement creates market expectations
- Deviations may slow fundraising
