## Overview

The **ILPA Model LPA** is the industry-standard template for private equity fund formation. Released in two versions (Whole of Fund and Deal by Deal waterfall structures), it provides comprehensive, balanced terms that reflect ILPA Principles.

## WOF vs. DBD Comparison

### Whole of Fund (WOF) Waterfall

**Structure:**
```
All investments → Calculate total fund return → If above hurdle:
    → LPs get preferred return (8%)
    → GP catches up to 20% overall
    → Remaining profits split 80/20
```

**Characteristics:**
- GP earns carry only on overall fund performance
- Protects LPs from individual deal losses
- More LP-favorable
- More common in larger, established funds
- Simpler clawback provisions

**Best For:**
- Funds with diverse portfolio (10+ investments)
- Established managers with track record
- LP-heavy negotiating environment
- Conservative LP base

### Deal by Deal (DBD) Waterfall

**Structure:**
```
Each investment → Calculate deal return → If above hurdle:
    → LP gets preferred return (8% on that deal)
    → GP catches up to 20% on that deal
    → Remaining profits split 80/20
    → GP receives carry immediately upon realization
```

**Characteristics:**
- GP earns carry on each successful investment
- Requires clawback provision (GP may owe money back)
- More GP-favorable for early wins
- More common in emerging manager funds
- Complex clawback calculations

**Best For:**
- Smaller funds (<10 investments)
- Emerging managers
- Strategies with concentrated portfolios
- Earlier monetization for GP team

### Key Decision Factors

| Factor | Favors WOF | Favors DBD |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Fund size | >$500M | <$250M |
| # of investments | 15+ | 5-10 |
| LP sophistication | Institutional heavy | Mixed |
| GP experience | Established | Emerging |
| Investment pace | Steady over time | Concentrated early |
| Exit timeline | Back-end loaded | Front-loaded |

## Customization for Emerging Managers

### What to Keep from ILPA Model

**Don't Negotiate Unless Necessary:**
- Basic governance structure
- LP protection provisions
- Transparency and reporting commitments
- Conflict procedures
- Key person framework

**Why**: These signal LP-friendly approach and reduce negotiation friction

### Common EM Modifications

**Acceptable Deviations:**
- **Fund Size**: Adjust commitment minimums for smaller fund
- **Investment Pace**: Shorter investment period for concentrated strategies
- **Co-Investment**: Structure based on EM capacity to source deals
- **GP Commitment**: Phase in over time if needed (but commit to 1-3%)

**Explain Carefully:**
- **DBD Waterfall**: Justify based on fund size and strategy
- **Fee Structure**: Any non-standard calculations
- **LPAC Selection**: If limiting LP eligibility (though not recommended)

---

## Red Flags for LPs

### Economics
- Management fee >2.5% or <1.5% (outliers need explanation)
- No management fee step-down
- <50% offset on transaction fees
- Organizational expenses >$2M or >2% of fund size
- Catch-up >20% or no catch-up at all

### Governance
- No LPAC or purely advisory LPAC
- Difficult or impossible GP removal
- Very high amendment thresholds (>75%)
- Weak key person provisions
- No key person suspension of investment period

### Operations
- No commitment to ILPA reporting templates
- Quarterly reports >60 days after quarter-end
- Vague expense definitions
- Unlimited subscription line usage
- No valuation policy
