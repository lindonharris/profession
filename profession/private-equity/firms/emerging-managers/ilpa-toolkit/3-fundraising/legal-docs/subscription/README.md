# Subscription Agreement

**Location**: `3-fundraising/legal-docs/subscription/`
**Files**: 3 (1 guide + 1 Word template + 1 PDF reference)
**Purpose**: Individual LP commitment and fund entry document

---

## Overview

The **Subscription Agreement** is the legal document each LP executes to formally commit capital to the fund. It creates a binding obligation and incorporates the LPA terms by reference.

**Analogy**: If the LPA is the fund's constitution, the Subscription Agreement is each LP's individual pledge and commitment to that constitution.

## Side Letters

### What Are Side Letters?

**Definition**: Separate agreements between GP and individual LP that modify or supplement standard fund terms.

**Common Provisions:**
- Fee discounts or rebates
- Additional co-investment rights
- Enhanced information rights
- Additional LPAC representation
- Specific investment restrictions
- Regulatory accommodations

### Side Letter Strategy for Emerging Managers

**Minimize Side Letters:**
- Keep standard terms consistent
- Resist LP-specific economics
- Focus on operational accommodations

**Acceptable Side Letter Items:**
- Regulatory requirements (ERISA, insurance regulations)
- Information format preferences
- Invoice/payment logistics
- Contact preferences

**Avoid Unless Necessary:**
- Fee discounts (breaks alignment)
- Enhanced economics (triggers MFN)
- Unique governance rights
- Investment restrictions

### MFN Implications

**Most Favored Nation Provision:**
"If any other LP receives more favorable terms, this LP automatically receives those terms as well."

**Why It Matters:**
- One side letter discount → all MFN LPs get discount
- Governance right to one → all MFN LPs entitled
- Creates cascading obligations
- Can significantly impact fund economics

**Best Practice**: Disclose all side letters to LPs or provide summary of material terms

## Commitment Tracking

### First Close Mechanics

**Typical Structure:**
- **Minimum**: 50-66% of target fund size
- **Deadline**: 12-24 months after fundraising start
- **Extensions**: 1-2 extensions of 3-6 months (if needed)

**Example:**
- Target fund: $150M
- First close minimum: $100M (66%)
- First close date: Month 18
- Subscription deadline: 2 weeks before first close

### Subsequent Closes

**Process:**
- Occurs every 3-6 months after first close
- New LPs join at same terms
- May require "interest equalization" payment
- Final close typically 12 months after first close

**Interest Equalization:**
New LPs may pay interest to first close LPs to reflect time value of earlier commitment

### Commitment Tracking System

**Essential Information:**
- LP name and commitment amount
- Close participation (first, second, final)
- Execution date
- Wire instructions
- MFN status
- Side letter summary
- Capital called to date
- Capital distributed to date

## Critical Considerations for Emerging Managers

### Keep It Standard

**Why Consistency Matters:**
- Simplifies administration
- Reduces legal costs
- Minimizes MFN complications
- Demonstrates fairness
- Eases future fundraising

### Representations Matter

**Don't Accept Without Verification:**
- Accredited investor status (verify with LP counsel)
- ERISA compliance (obtain legal opinion if needed)
- Beneficial ownership (satisfy AML/KYC requirements)

**Why**: GP can have liability if LP representations are false

### Capital Call Discipline

**Establish Clear Procedures:**
- Standard notice period (10-15 days)
- Consistent format and content
- Clear wire instructions
- Default provisions (and willingness to enforce)
- Communication protocol

### MFN Policy

**Decide Early:**
- Economic MFN (fees, carry)?
- Information MFN (reporting)?
- Governance MFN (LPAC)?
- Exceptions (regulatory, operational)?

**Document Clearly**: In both Subscription Agreement and any side letters
