## LPA - Limited Partnership Agreement

**Location**: `legal-docs/lpa/`
**Files**: 7 total

### What is the LPA?

The **LPA is the fund's constitutional document** that governs:
- Fund structure and purpose
- Economic terms (fees, carry, expenses)
- Governance and decision-making
- LP rights and protections
- GP obligations and powers
- Reporting and transparency
- Term and lifecycle
- Dissolution and liquidation

**Analogy**: If the fund is a company, the LPA is its bylaws, shareholder agreement, and operating manual combined.

### Two Versions Available

**1. Whole of Fund (WOF) Waterfall**
- Traditional carried interest structure
- GP earns carry on overall fund performance
- More common in larger funds
- LP-favorable for underperforming deals

**2. Deal by Deal (DBD) Waterfall**
- GP earns carry on each successful investment
- More common in smaller/emerging funds
- GP-favorable for early successes
- Requires clawback provision

**See**: [lpa/README.md](lpa/README.md) for detailed comparison

## Subscription Agreement

**Location**: `legal-docs/subscription/`
**Files**: 3 total

### What is the Subscription Agreement?

The **Subscription Agreement is each LP's individual commitment document** that:
- Formalizes capital commitment
- Provides LP representations and warranties
- Establishes payment mechanics
- Addresses tax elections
- Incorporates LPA terms by reference
- Creates binding legal obligation

**Analogy**: If the LPA is the fund's constitution, the Subscription Agreement is each LP's individual oath and commitment.

**See**: [subscription/README.md](subscription/README.md) for details

## Document Relationship

### How They Work Together

```
LPA (Fund-Level Document)
    ↓ defines terms
    ↓ incorporated by reference
    ↓
Subscription Agreement (LP-Specific Document)
    ↓ creates obligation
    ↓ based on LPA terms
    ↓
Capital Commitment (Individual LP)
```

**Key Principle**: LPA sets the rules, Subscription Agreement is each player's agreement to follow those rules.

### Timing Sequence

```
Week 1-10: LPA DRAFTING
    ↓
Week 8-16: LPA NEGOTIATIONS
    ↓ (terms finalized)
Week 14-18: SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENTS PREPARED
    ↓ (incorporate final LPA)
Week 16-20: SUBSCRIPTION EXECUTION
    ↓ (LPs commit)
Week 18-24: FIRST CLOSE
```
