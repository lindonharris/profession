# Subscription Lines - Guidance & Best Practices

**Location**: `4-operations/subscription-lines/`
**Files**: 3 (1 guide + 2 PDF guidance documents)
**Purpose**: Proper use and disclosure of subscription line credit facilities

---

## Overview

**Subscription lines of credit** (also called capital call facilities) are credit facilities secured by LP capital commitments. They're used to fund investments and expenses prior to calling capital from LPs.

**Controversial Topic**: Can inflate IRR and mask deployment pace, so transparency is critical.

## What Are Subscription Lines?

### Basic Structure

**How It Works:**
```
1. Fund establishes credit facility with bank
2. Facility is secured by LP capital commitments
3. Fund draws on facility to fund investments/expenses
4. Fund repays facility with capital called from LPs
5. Process repeats throughout investment period
```

**Typical Terms:**
- Size: 10-25% of fund commitments
- Duration: Each draw repaid within 30-180 days
- Cost: SOFR + 150-250 bps
- Covenants: Standard bank requirements

### Common Uses

**Appropriate Uses (Per ILPA):**
- Bridge financing between investment closing and capital call
- Manage capital call timing and frequency
- Cover fund expenses between calls
- Smooth LP cash flow management

**Questionable Uses:**
- Artificially inflate IRR by delaying capital calls
- Mask slow deployment pace
- Reduce GP urgency to call capital
- Enable over-leverage at fund level

## The IRR Inflation Problem

### How It Happens

**Without Subscription Line:**
```
Day 1: Call $10M from LPs
Day 1: Invest $10M (IRR starts)
Day 365: Exit for $15M
IRR = 50%
```

**With Subscription Line:**
```
Day 1: Draw $10M from facility
Day 1: Invest $10M (IRR starts)
Day 90: Call $10M from LPs, repay facility
Day 365: Exit for $15M
IRR = 62% (inflated by 90-day delay)
```

**Problem**: Same investment, but IRR appears 12% higher due to subscription line use

### Why LPs Care

**Comparison Issues:**
- Can't compare managers who use lines differently
- Historical returns may be inflated
- Benchmark comparisons distorted
- True performance obscured

**Alignment Concerns:**
- Reduces GP incentive to deploy efficiently
- Masks capital deployment issues
- May delay recognition of problems
- Creates false sense of outperformance

## ILPA Disclosure Requirements

### 2017 Guidance (Basic)

**Required Disclosures:**
- Existence and terms of facility
- Maximum size and usage limits
- Cost to fund
- Impact on returns (qualitative)

### 2020 Guidance (Enhanced)

**Required Annual Disclosure:**
- Detailed usage during period
- Days outstanding for each draw
- Aggregate cost to fund
- Impact on IRR (quantitative)
- "Clean" IRR without subscription line
- Comparison table

**Quarterly Reporting:**
- Current outstanding balance
- Usage during quarter
- Cost allocated to fund
- Compliance with stated policies

---

## Best Practices for Emerging Managers

### LPA Provisions

**Include in LPA:**
- Maximum facility size (% of commitments)
- Duration limits per draw
- Permitted uses
- Cost allocation
- Disclosure commitments
- LPAC notification thresholds

**Example Provisions:**
- "Facility shall not exceed 20% of total commitments"
- "No single draw shall remain outstanding >90 days"
- "Fund shall disclose usage quarterly and calculate IRR with and without facility"

### Usage Guidelines

**Do:**
- Use sparingly and strategically
- Limit duration (30-90 days preferred)
- Repay promptly with capital calls
- Disclose usage transparently
- Calculate "clean" IRR
- Stay within stated limits

**Don't:**
- Use routinely for all investments
- Leave drawn for >90 days without explanation
- Fail to disclose impact on returns
- Exceed stated policy limits
- Use to mask deployment issues

### Disclosure Approach

**Quarterly Reports:**
- Current balance outstanding
- Purpose of current draws
- Days outstanding
- Cost to fund this quarter
- Cumulative cost to date

**Annual Reports:**
- Complete usage summary
- IRR with subscription line
- IRR without subscription line
- Explanation of material usage
- Compliance attestation

## LP Perspectives

### Why Some LPs Accept Subscription Lines

**Operational Benefits:**
- Reduces capital call frequency
- Smooths cash flow planning
- Enables faster deal execution
- Minimizes transaction costs
- Professional fund management

### Why Some LPs Dislike Subscription Lines

**Alignment Concerns:**
- IRR inflation distorts performance
- Reduces deployment urgency
- May mask problems
- Complicates manager comparison
- Questions about necessity

### The Compromise

**Acceptable to Most LPs If:**
- Limited duration (≤90 days)
- Transparent disclosure
- "Clean" IRR calculated
- Reasonable business purpose
- Not routine/excessive

## Emerging Manager Decision Framework

### Should You Use a Subscription Line?

**Consider Using If:**
- Need to smooth capital call frequency
- Want to reduce LP administrative burden
- Face timing mismatches on deals
- LPs are sophisticated and comfortable
- Can implement transparency measures

**Probably Avoid If:**
- Very small fund (<$50M)
- Cost is material to returns
- LPs are wary or inexperienced
- Would use routinely (not strategically)
- Can't implement strong disclosure

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Costs:**
- Interest expense (SOFR + 150-250 bps)
- Facility fees (0.25-0.50% annually)
- Legal and setup costs ($25K-$75K)
- Ongoing administrative burden
- LP relationship management

**Benefits:**
- Operational flexibility
- Fewer capital calls
- Faster deal execution
- Competitive advantage on timing
- Professional appearance

**Break-Even**: Typically only worthwhile for funds >$100M

## Alternatives to Subscription Lines

### Other Approaches

**More Frequent Capital Calls:**
- No cost
- No IRR distortion
- Full transparency
- More LP administrative burden

**Longer Capital Call Notice:**
- Give LPs 30 days instead of 10-15
- No cost
- Builds in timing buffer
- May slow deal execution

**GP Bridge Financing:**
- GP provides temporary capital
- Repaid on next call
- No fund-level cost
- Demonstrates GP commitment
- Limited by GP resources

**Just-in-Time Calling:**
- Call capital precisely when needed
- No facility required
- Maximum transparency
- Requires very efficient processes

## Regulatory Considerations

### SEC Scrutiny

**Areas of Focus:**
- Allocation of facility costs
- Disclosure to LPs
- Impact on performance fees
- Conflicts of interest
- Fair representation

**Best Practice**: Over-disclose and document rationale

### Compliance Requirements

**Documentation:**
- LPA authorization
- LPAC approval (if required)
- Bank documentation
- Usage tracking
- Cost allocation methodology
- Performance calculation methodology
