# ILPA Subscription Lines of Credit Guidance

## Overview

ILPA has issued comprehensive guidance on **subscription lines of credit** (also called capital call facilities) to address their impact on LP interests, transparency, and performance measurement.

### Two-Phase Guidance

1. **June 2017** - Original guidance on alignment of interests
2. **June 2020** - Enhanced transparency and disclosure standards

## What Are Subscription Lines of Credit?

**Definition:** Short-term credit facilities secured by uncalled LP capital commitments

**Purpose:**
- Bridge financing between capital calls
- Immediate deal funding without LP capital calls
- Operational flexibility for GPs
- Expense management timing

**How They Work:**
```
GP identifies investment → Draws on credit line →
Funds investment immediately → Calls LP capital later →
Repays credit line
```

## Why ILPA Issued Guidance

### Key Concerns for LPs

1. **Performance Distortion**
   - IRR inflation through delayed capital calls
   - Difficulty comparing funds with different line usage
   - Opaque impact on returns measurement

2. **Alignment of Interests**
   - GPs benefit from higher reported IRRs
   - LPs may not understand true performance
   - Costs passed through to LPs without clear disclosure

3. **Transparency Gaps**
   - Inconsistent disclosure across funds
   - Lack of standardized reporting
   - Difficulty monitoring exposure and costs

## 2017 Guidance: Alignment of Interests

### Core Principles

**Transparency**
- Clear disclosure of subscription line policies in LPA
- Explicit parameters for usage
- Ongoing reporting to LPs

**Appropriate Use**
- Short-term bridge financing (not long-term leverage)
- Reasonable limits on duration and amount
- Consistent with fund strategy

**Cost Disclosure**
- All-in costs clearly reported
- Impact on fund economics shown
- Comparison to unlevered performance

### Key Recommendations (2017)

1. **LPA Provisions**
   - Maximum borrowing limits
   - Maximum duration of borrowings
   - Permitted purposes for use
   - Default provisions

2. **Performance Reporting**
   - Report both levered and unlevered IRRs
   - Disclose impact of credit lines on returns
   - Provide transparency on timing effects

3. **Cost Allocation**
   - Clear disclosure of all costs
   - Management fee calculations
   - Interest and fees broken out

## 2020 Enhanced Guidance: Transparency Standards

### Specific Quarterly Disclosures

LPs should receive in **every quarterly report:**

1. **Outstanding Balance**
   - Current credit line balance
   - Maximum facility size
   - Percentage of facility utilized

2. **Vintage and Duration**
   - Age of each borrowing
   - Average duration of outstanding amounts
   - Longest outstanding borrowing

3. **Purpose**
   - What borrowings funded (investments, expenses, distributions)
   - Allocation between different uses

4. **Costs**
   - Interest rates paid
   - Facility fees
   - All-in cost of borrowing
   - Total cost to date

5. **Impact on Capital Calls**
   - Delayed capital calls due to line usage
   - Projected timing of calls to repay line

### Annual Disclosures

In addition to quarterly reporting, **annual reports** should include:

1. **Performance Impact**
   - Fund IRR with subscription line
   - Fund IRR without subscription line (unlevered)
   - MOIC/TVPI with and without line impact
   - Clear comparison showing delta

2. **Historical Usage**
   - Average daily balance for the year
   - Maximum balance during year
   - Number of days with outstanding balance
   - Trends over fund life

3. **Terms and Conditions**
   - Interest rate structure (fixed/floating)
   - Commitment fees
   - Covenants and restrictions
   - Lender information

4. **Policy Compliance**
   - Adherence to LPA parameters
   - Any exceptions or waivers
   - Changes to policies during year

## Impact on Performance Metrics

### IRR Distortion Example

**Without Subscription Line:**
- LP called for capital: Day 1
- Investment made: Day 1
- Exit: Year 3
- True IRR: 20%

**With Subscription Line:**
- Investment made: Day 1 (from credit line)
- LP called for capital: Day 180
- Exit: Year 3
- Reported IRR: 25% (artificially inflated)

**Why:** Same cash flows to LP, but delayed capital call makes IRR calculation appear better

### MOIC/TVPI Less Affected
- Multiple on Invested Capital (MOIC) not timing-dependent
- Total Value to Paid-In (TVPI) more reliable comparison
- **Key Insight:** Focus on cash-on-cash returns, not just IRR

## Best Practices for Emerging Managers

### In the LPA (Before Fundraising)

1. **Clear Parameters**
   - Maximum facility size (% of commitments)
   - Maximum duration for any single borrowing
   - Prohibited uses (if any)

2. **Transparent Policies**
   - Purpose and rationale for line
   - Expected frequency of use
   - Commitment to dual performance reporting

3. **Cost Allocation**
   - How interest and fees are treated
   - Impact on management fee calculations
   - LP responsibility for costs

### During Fund Operations

1. **Conservative Use**
   - Use for short-term bridge financing only
   - Avoid using to artificially boost IRR
   - Quick repayment (30-90 days typical)

2. **Transparent Reporting**
   - Follow ILPA quarterly disclosure standards
   - Provide both levered and unlevered returns
   - Explain variances and timing impact

3. **LP Communication**
   - Proactive discussion of usage
   - Answer questions about strategy
   - Demonstrate alignment with LP interests

## Questions for Emerging Manager Due Diligence

When evaluating emerging managers, ask:

1. **Policy Questions**
   - "What is your policy on subscription line usage?"
   - "What are the maximum size and duration limits in your LPA?"
   - "What purposes do you use the line for?"

2. **Transparency Questions**
   - "Do you report both levered and unlevered IRR?"
   - "How do you disclose subscription line costs?"
   - "Can I see a sample quarterly report showing line disclosures?"

3. **Alignment Questions**
   - "How do you ensure subscription line use doesn't distort performance reporting?"
   - "Have you ever exceeded LPA limits on the line?"
   - "How do you think about tradeoffs between operational flexibility and transparency?"

## Red Flags to Watch

⚠️ **Warning Signs:**

1. **Excessive Duration**
   - Borrowings outstanding for 6+ months
   - Using line as permanent leverage
   - Pattern of rolling over borrowings

2. **Lack of Transparency**
   - Only reporting levered IRR
   - Vague or missing line disclosures
   - Resistance to questions about line usage

3. **IRR Management**
   - Using line primarily near fund end to boost IRR
   - Delaying capital calls strategically for performance
   - Significant gap between reported and unlevered IRR

4. **Cost Issues**
   - Unclear cost allocation
   - High all-in costs eating into returns
   - Costs not fully disclosed to LPs

## Strategic Context for Recruiting

### Why This Matters for Your Conversations

**Demonstrates Sophistication:**
- Understanding of LP concerns shows depth
- Knowledge of ILPA standards signals seriousness
- Ability to discuss nuances impresses interviewers

**Intelligent Questions:**
- "How do you think about subscription line usage in your funds?"
- "I saw ILPA's 2020 enhanced guidance on transparency—how has that affected your reporting?"
- "Do you provide both levered and unlevered performance metrics to your LPs?"

**Shows LP Perspective:**
- Alignment of interests awareness
- Understanding of performance measurement challenges
- Recognition of transparency importance

## For Future GP Aspirations

### First-Time Fund Considerations

**Should Emerging Managers Use Subscription Lines?**

**Pros:**
- Operational flexibility
- Quick execution on time-sensitive deals
- Smooth out capital call timing
- Industry standard practice

**Cons:**
- Additional costs to fund
- Complexity in reporting
- Potential LP concerns
- Risk of IRR management perception

**ILPA's Position:** Not opposed to use, but requires transparency

### Implementation Checklist

If using subscription lines as a first-time GP:

- [ ] Set clear LPA limits (typically 15-25% of commitments)
