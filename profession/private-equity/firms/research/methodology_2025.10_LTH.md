# Preqin Advanced Fund Manager Search Results

**Database:** Preqin (HBS Baker Library) | **Date:** October 14, 2025 | **Geography:** NY, IL

## Overview

Initial search targeted PE firms in NYC and Chicago across buyout, growth, hybrid, and special situations strategies ($250M+ dry powder, $500M+ total capital raised). After iterative filtering to remove VC/growth equity, sector specialists, fund-of-funds, and smaller fundraisers (<$500M/year), the dataset converged on 25 large-scale, independent, generalist buyout firms suitable for comparative analysis against emerging manager opportunities.

**Result:** 197 → 25 firms | **Removed:** 174 firms across 3 filter passes | **Added:** 2 firms from PitchBook

**Note:** Dataset sorted by PE Dry Powder per Person (descending) as a proxy for near-term acquisition capacity—firms with higher dry powder per person are positioned to be more acquisitive for both deals and talent in the current deployment cycle.
