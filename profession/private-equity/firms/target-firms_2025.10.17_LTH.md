# Target Firms List (Oct. 2025)

## Overview

Initial search targeted PE firms in NYC and Chicago across buyout, growth, hybrid, and special situations strategies ($250M+ dry powder, $500M+ total capital raised). After iterative filtering to remove VC/growth equity, sector specialists, fund-of-funds, and smaller fundraisers (<$500M/year), the dataset converged on 25 large-scale, independent, generalist buyout firms suitable for comparative analysis against emerging manager opportunities.

**Result:** 219 → 25 firms | **Removed:** 194 firms across 3 filter passes (detailed further below)

**Note:** Dataset sorted by PE Dry Powder per Person (descending) as a proxy for near-term acquisition capacity—firms with higher dry powder per person are positioned to be more acquisitive for both deals and talent in the current deployment cycle.

---

### Firm-Specific Notes

#### **Goldman Sachs XIG** ⚠️
- **2009-2010 Context:** Unable to raise outside capital due to poor deal performance
- **Track Record:** Spotty overall, particularly outside healthcare and tech
- **Culture:** Still more focused on investment banking side than PE
- **Sebastien's Take:** His least favorite option for me

#### **26North Partners** ⭐
- **Structure:** Great opportunity for close collaboration with Josh Harris and founders
- **Deal Sourcing:** Preemptive deals rather than auction-driven
- **Strategy:** Alpha-oriented approach with founder-level access

#### **Pritzker Private Capital**
- **Philosophy:** Don't waste time on deals—high selectivity
- **Trade-off:** Everything you do is valuable, but fewer deals per year
- **Approach:** Buy-to-build vs. buy-to-sell philosophy

#### **GTCR**
- **Strengths:** Very good at preemptive sourcing within middle-market industrials
- **Volume:** More deal-volume focused
- **Strategy:** 'Leaders Strategy' across four core sectors

#### **Bregal Sagemount**
- **Differentiator:** Does interesting structuring work
- **Focus:** Growth-focused PE with flexible capital approach

#### **Blue Owl**
- **Differentiator:** Does interesting structuring work
- **Strategy:** Very niche approach (GP stakes, direct lending, credit solutions)

#### **BDT Capital Partners** 🔍
*Detailed insights from Sebastien (currently at BDT)*

**Business Model:**
- Merchant bank: 50% advising + 50% investing
- 100% focused on family-led businesses (expanding to closely-held businesses with principal-like founders)
- Everyone below certain level works half IB / half investing

**Investment Banking Side:**
- Bespoke work: IPO, sell-side, buy-side, restructuring
- Not leaderboard-seeking
- Generalist approach

**Founding Story:**
- Byron Trott was chairman of Goldman Sachs investment bank
- Too much red tape at Goldman
- Wanted to create firm that could offer families either advice OR capital (or both)

**Investment Structure:**
- Fund life: 16 years + two 1-year extensions
- Principally minority deals
- Low-levered or unlevered investments
- Typically structured with:
  - Put rights for BDT
  - Call rights for target owner
  - Predetermined multiples
- Philosophy: Never force families to sell to buyers they don't want

**MSD Capital Merger Context:**
- **BDT's Historical Focus:** Old money industries (industrials, real estate, manufacturing)
- **BDT's Gap:** Wanted capabilities in new money industries (healthcare, growth)
- **MSD's Position:** Michael Dell wanted to raise private equity (had credit, real estate, tech but no PE)
- **Merger Rationale:** Complementary competencies

**Pre-Merger Culture:**
- Chicago-based
- Smaller, more diverse, less fratty
- More like Goldman culture

**Post-Merger Concerns (Sebastien's perspective):**
- ⚠️ Power nexus has shifted meaningfully
- ⚠️ Worried about institutional investors in funds historically committed to families
- ⚠️ Risk of becoming "just another behemoth"
- ⚠️ Worried about losing differentiation

**Compensation:**
- Above-market on all fronts

**Why Sebastien Loves It:**
- Ability to create strategy and grow with firm
- Long-term vision (e.g., eventually investing in sports)
