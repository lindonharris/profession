## Strategic Notes

### Plan A Philosophy
Finding an "Arctos pre-Fund I close" opportunity - an emerging manager looking to take a risk on me because I'm taking a risk on them. Either a high performing emerging manager or a bespoke strategy within a larger fund where I can have meaningful impact.

**Examples:**
- **Emerging Managers:** 26-North, BDT & MSD Partners, Blue Owl, Hunter Point, New-Catalyst
- **Bespoke Strategies:** Apollo Sports Fund, Sixth Street Growth (Sports), Blackstone Tactical Opportunities

### Plan B Reality
Megafund PE, especially buyout, is a grind even at VP level. Maybe 1 out of 10 VPs will be "pulled up" on path to partner. Firms procedurally hiring VPs on campus every year signal commensurate churn in middle management. However, these provide strong optionality and compensation.

**Strategic Considerations:**
- Special situations strategies may offer better differentiation than pure buyout
- Platform specialists (secondaries, GP stakes) can provide unique skill development
- Use as compensation/brand benchmarks when evaluating Plan A opportunities
- Consider as stepping stones vs. long-term homes

### Key Insight
Don't let talent go to waste parked at a large firm that doesn't want to invest in long-term ownership. Don't need validation or to prove I can "do the work" - don't get blinded by that insecurity.

### Exclusion Criteria
**Hedge Funds:** Any hedge fund should be qualified out regardless of strategy alignment. Focus exclusively on PE, credit, and alternatives at non-hedge fund platforms.
