- **Value Creation:** Operational improvement through KKR Capstone consulting arm

**Headquarters:** New York, NY

**Key Differentiators:**

---

## Plan B Considerations

**Strengths:**
- Strong brand and exit opportunities
- Proven operational value creation model (Capstone)
- Structured career progression
- Global platform with diverse opportunities

**Concerns:**
- High competition for partner track
- "Megafund grind" considerations apply
- Structured hierarchy may limit ownership/sponsorship early
- Lower likelihood of long-term sponsorship vs. emerging managers

---

## Research Needed

- Current Americas fund size and strategy
- Associate/VP retention and promotion rates
- Specific sector teams and coverage areas
- Hiring timeline and process for MBA candidates
- Integration between buyout and other KKR platforms (credit, infrastructure)
- KKR Capstone engagement model for portfolio companies

---

## Strategic Assessment

**Plan B Rationale:**
- Strong optionality play if Plan A (emerging managers/bespoke strategies) doesn't materialize
- Brand value and compensation competitive with other megafunds
- Operational focus may provide differentiated skill development vs. pure financial engineering
- Global platform offers geographic flexibility

**Risk Factors:**
- May not align with "Arctos pre-Fund I" thesis (meaningful market share early)
- Traditional megafund career path concerns (1 in 10 VPs pulled to partner)
- Less differentiation vs. other megafund buyout platforms
- Higher probability of "parking lot" vs. long-term sponsorship

**Positioning:**
- Frame as learning opportunity at proven operational platform
- Leverage Arctos experience for portfolio company value creation discussions
- Consider as stepping stone vs. long-term home
- Use as benchmark for compensation/brand when evaluating Plan A opportunities
