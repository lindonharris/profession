- Growth and impact platforms provide alternatives to pure buyout

## Research Needed

- Current Capital fund size and deployment pace
- Hiring process and timeline for MBA candidates
- Sector team structures and focus areas
- MBA hiring patterns and career progression
- Associate/VP retention rates

## Strategic Assessment

**Plan B Rationale:**
- Strong optionality play if Plan A doesn't materialize
- Sector focus may provide differentiation vs. pure generalist
- Platform diversity offers pivot opportunities
- Brand value competitive with other megafunds

**Risk Factors:**
- Public company structure may increase pressure
- Traditional megafund career path concerns (1 in 10 VPs to partner)
- Less differentiation vs. Apollo, Blackstone, KKR buyout
- May not align with "meaningful market share" thesis

**Questions to Answer:**
- How has public company status affected culture?
- What's MBA hiring volume and success rate?
- Do sector teams have autonomy or centralized decision-making?
- How integrated is impact investing? Required participation?
- What's retention and promotion rate for post-MBA hires?
- How does TPG Capital differentiate from competitors?

**Likely Positioning:**
- Benchmark for compensation and brand vs. other Plan B options
- Sector team approach may offer slight differentiation
- Public company structure interesting but unclear if advantage/disadvantage
- Consider if specific sector team aligns with interests
