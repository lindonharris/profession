## Target Strategies

### Tactical Opportunities - Tier 2 (Primary Target)
- **Focus:** $34B+ AUM unconstrained special situations mandate - premier platform for bespoke structured solutions across industries
- **Why Target (IMOW):** Advantaged deal flow. Learning from the best of the best. Solutions architecture across capital structure. One of few teams recruiting senior associates from business school
- **Fund Status:** Currently deploying Fund IV; fundraising for Fund V mid-2026
- **Investment Types:** Structured equity/credit, preferred equity, creative partner capital, sponsored DPI trades, some control investments (primarily non-control), AI infrastructure financing
- **Sizing:** Nothing below $200M worth time given scale ($34B+ AUM)
- **Returns:** Downside protection + portfolio convexity; outcomes between PE and infrastructure
- **Tier Rationale:** Special situations expertise offers differentiation; smaller team with more exposure

### Growth Equity - Tier 2 (Secondary)
- **Focus:** Minority growth investments in established companies
- **Why Target:** Alternative to traditional buyout; differentiated skill development
- **Status:** Secondary research target

### Strategic Partners - Tier 2 (Additional)
- **Focus:** Secondaries, GP minority stakes, structured solutions for fund managers
- **Why Target:** Platform specialist expertise; may offer better long-term positioning than buyout
- **Status:** Exploring

### Buyout - Not Primary Target
- **Focus:** Flagship large-cap buyout platform
- **Why Not Primary:** Traditional megafund grind; lower likelihood of long-term sponsorship; "parking lot" risk
- **Status:** Aware but deprioritized

## Key Contacts & Intel

### John Watson (MD, Tactical Opportunities - Sports & Media Focus)
- **Focus Areas:** Sports, media, technology, AI infrastructure
- **Key Insights:**
  - Works closely with Ifeanyi Isichei on all things tech/AI infrastructure
  - TO spending less time on regular-way pref equity solutions
  - Reputation as "place you call when you don't know what to do"
  - Continually creating new investment forms (e.g., CoreWeave $7.5B structured GPU financing)
  - Consider yourself "solutions architect"
  - Sports/media interesting; structured finance capabilities important for those discussions
  - **Direct feedback:** "Would be potentially interested in someone of your experience with Arctos expertise"
  - "Bought into my thesis for being a structured equity/credit specialist... special situations investor long-term"
  - **Action:** Stay in touch with John and Ifeanyi; reach out once you start school

### Ifeanyi Isichei (VP, Tactical Opportunities - Digital Infrastructure)
- **Background:** Nigeria → UK → Princeton → BLK internship → Goldman Sachs intern → Blackstone
- **Role:** Works closely with John Watson on tech/AI infrastructure
- **Focus:** Digital infrastructure, AI infrastructure theme (deployed $5.4B in one year from Fund IV)
- **Key Insights:**
  - Chris James (CJ) is global head; Chaz leads US digital infrastructure (CoreWeave, software infra); Cassum leads EMEA (FIG, insurance)
  - CJ very involved in Black ERG at Blackstone; great Black senior leadership
  - John Watson focuses on sports and media
  - No neat sector splits in Tac Opps; MDs have 2-3 verticals of focus
  - Value creation vs. financial engineering is very deal-dependent
  - Most people home-grown; would MUCH rather internally promote than externally hire
  - **Tac Opps doesn't do structured post-MBA hiring** - recent MBA hire came through military internship (3 years since prior)
  - If not military, hiring through relationships only
  - Culture is "fantastic" and people are "kind"

### Leadership Context
- **David Blitzer:** Runs day-to-day; stepping down end of 2025 (perhaps co-head with Chris James)
- **Chris James (CJ):** Global head; face of fundraising; involved in Black ERG
- **Chaz:** US digital infrastructure lead
- **Cassum:** EMEA lead (FIG, insurance focus)

## Tactical Opportunities Deep Dive

**Investment Philosophy:**
- "Catch-all" group: asset stripping, preferred equity, growth equity, credit structures, music royalties, sports teams/leagues
- No two deals are the same
- Play across entire capital structure
- Hard to find opportunities without intermediary; avoid auctions
- Solving for downside protection + portfolio convexity
- Use fixed income component as cash performance floor + upside through warrants/other securities

**Recent Focus Areas:**
- AI infrastructure (CoreWeave $7.5B structured GPU financing)
- Sports media (structured finance capabilities important)
- Creative partner capital
- Sponsored DPI trades
- Operating company bespoke solutions (sometimes partnering with other GPs)

**Team Structure:**
- 40 investment professionals in US
- Half to 2/3s in London
- Australia and Asia team
- Very small SF team
- General career path: Analyst → Associate → Senior Associate → Principal
- **Hiring:** Don't do much senior associate hiring; historically recruited MBAs but now rare

**Comparable Strategies:**
- Apollo Hybrid Value
- Ares Fund
- CVC Strategic Opportunities

## HBS Recruiting Context

**Tac Opps Specific:**
- One of the few teams that recruit senior associates from business school
- No structured post-MBA hiring process
- Recent MBA hires: military internship (most recent), then 3 years prior
- Otherwise hiring through relationships only
- Advice: Connect early, build relationships, demonstrate Arctos expertise + structured equity/credit interest

**General Process:**
- Connect with handful of people in advance
- Talk to as many people in organization as possible
- Culture prioritizes internal promotions over external hires

## Strategic Assessment

**Why Tactical Opportunities (Primary):**
- Aligns with long-term structured equity/credit specialist thesis
- One of few megafund teams recruiting MBAs at senior associate level
- Solutions architecture approach matches skillset and interests
- Direct interest expressed in Arctos experience + special situations background
- Smaller team within large platform = more exposure + megafund resources
- Differentiated skill development vs. traditional buyout grind

**Advantages:**
- Relationship already established (John Watson, Ifeanyi Isichei)
- Clear strategic fit acknowledged by team
- Unconstrained mandate offers variety and complexity
- Strong brand + compensation without pure buyout "parking lot" risk
- Learning opportunity from best-in-class special situations team

**Challenges:**
- Limited structured MBA hiring (relationships-based only)
- Need to maintain and deepen John/Ifeanyi connections through HBS
- Competitive even for relationship-based hires
- David Blitzer transition may create uncertainty

**Risk Factors:**
- Leadership transition (David Blitzer end of 2025)
- No guarantee of hire even with relationships
- Megafund scale still presents some "Plan B" concerns
- Need to differentiate from traditional MBA candidates

**Next Steps:**
1. Maintain contact with John Watson and Ifeanyi Isichei
2. Reach out as HBS matriculation approaches per John's guidance
3. Deepen understanding of recent TO deals (CoreWeave structure, sports deals)
4. Prepare narrative around Arctos → structured equity/credit specialist path
5. Explore Growth Equity and Strategic Partners as alternatives
6. Connect with other TO team members through John/Ifeanyi introductions
