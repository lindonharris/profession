## Strategic Assessment

**Plan B Positioning:**
- Growth orientation may offer better alignment than pure buyout
- Sector focus could enable specialization
- Global platform provides optionality
- Less structured than some peers may mean more flexibility

**Risk Factors:**
- Limited differentiation from other Plan B options
- Still megafund scale with associated concerns
- Unclear how growth vs. buyout is positioned internally
- May face same "parking lot" risks as other large platforms

**Questions to Answer:**
- What percentage of investments are growth vs. buyout?
- How do sector teams operate? (Autonomy vs. centralized?)
- What's MBA hiring pattern and career progression?
- How does WP differentiate from KKR, TPG, Apollo buyout platforms?
- Is growth investing truly differentiated or just smaller deal size buyout?
