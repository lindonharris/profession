## Target Strategies

### Buyout (Software Focus) - Tier 2
- **Focus:** Software buyout transactions across all sizes
- **Investment Types:** Enterprise software, SaaS, technology services
- **Value Creation:** Operational improvement through Thoma Bravo playbook (TBA operating model)
- **Specialization:** Software only - deep technical and operational focus
- **Why Target:** Sector specialization may offer differentiation; deep software expertise development
- **Tier Rationale:** Plan B option - sector focus provides specialization but may limit optionality outside tech

## Plan B Considerations

**Strengths:**
- Deep sector specialization (software only)
- Strong technical and operational focus
- Proven playbook and track record
- Less generalist competition (software background advantage)
- Operational skills highly transferable

**Concerns:**
- Sector specialization limits optionality outside software
- May require deeper software background than possessed
- "Megafund grind" considerations still apply
- Software focus may not align with sports/specialized interests
- Limited sector diversity vs. generalist platforms

---

## Research Needed

- Current fund size and strategy
- Team structure and hiring needs
- Career progression and retention for non-traditional software backgrounds
- Software background expectations for MBA hires
- How technical do you need to be? (Finance vs. engineering knowledge)
- Integration with portfolio companies (operational role vs. financial sponsor)
- Geographic distribution (Chicago vs. SF)
- MBA recruiting timeline and process

## Strategic Assessment

**Plan B Rationale:**
- Sector specialization may reduce competition
- Operational focus provides differentiated skills
- Strong brand in software PE space
- May offer better learning than generalist megafund

**Misalignment Concerns:**
- Software-only focus doesn't align with sports interests
- May limit future optionality if want to pivot sectors
- Unclear if Arctos experience translates (sports vs. software)
- Technical requirements may be barrier

**Questions to Answer:**
- Do they hire non-software backgrounds from MBA programs?
- How technical do roles get? (Financial vs. operational)
- What's retention for MBAs vs. banking/consulting hires?
- How specialized is too specialized for career optionality?
- Can software operational skills translate to other sectors later?

**Likely Deprioritization:**
- Software-only focus misaligned with sports/emerging manager interests
- Other Plan B options offer more sector flexibility
- Unclear strategic fit vs. Apollo, Blackstone TO, KKR
- May revisit if develop stronger software/tech investing interest
