## Target Strategies

### Sports Fund - Tier 1 (Primary Target)
- **Focus:** $5B dedicated sports and venue strategy covering franchises, leagues, sports-related infrastructure, media rights, and entertainment venues
- **Why Target:** Bespoke strategy within larger platform offering meaningful "market share" opportunity in specialized area. Leverages sports passion with institutional backing and Apollo's sophisticated structuring capabilities
- **Status:** Primary research target
- **Tier Rationale:** Emerging opportunity in specialized area where I can build significant expertise and influence

### Buyout - Tier 2 (Secondary)
- **Focus:** $90B flagship buyout platform - large-cap LBO with operational value creation
- **Why Target:** Traditional megafund optionality play. Strong compensation and exit opportunities
- **Status:** Plan B consideration
- **Note:** PE now smaller part of Apollo as firm shifts focus to credit and insurance platforms. At $25B fund scale, limited availability of interesting opportunities to return fund

### Hybrid Value - Additional Context
- **Focus:** 30-40 person team focused on downside protection through structured/preferred equity or debt + warrants (12-15% return range)
- **Structure:** Non-control oriented; complements buyout team when operational expertise needed
- **Note:** Apollo X PE (100 investors) does 12-15 associate hires annually, mostly from banking with only 3-4 laterals/MBA hires

## Strategic Assessment

**Primary Target (Sports Fund):**
- Aligns with "Arctos pre-Fund I" thesis - bespoke strategy opportunity
- Meaningful market share potential in specialized area
- Leverages personal passion with institutional platform
- Access to Apollo's world-class structuring capabilities

**Secondary Consideration (Buyout/Hybrid Value):**
- Strong brand and compensation
- Excellent learning environment
- Provides optionality if Plan A doesn't materialize
- Realistic about limited long-term partnership probability at megafund scale

**Risk Factors:**
- Sports Fund: Limited information on team structure, hiring needs, timeline
- Buyout: "Megafund grind" concerns; parking lot risk
- Firm Shift: PE becoming smaller focus as credit dominates
- Scale Challenge: $25B+ funds limit deal opportunities

**Next Steps:**
1. Research Sports Fund team structure and leadership
2. Identify Sports Fund recent deals and pipeline
3. Determine Sports Fund hiring process and timeline
4. Understand integration between Sports Fund and broader Apollo platform
5. Connect with John Watson (sports/media focus at Tac Opps for context)
6. Reach out to Victoria, Michael, Jamal as HBS matriculation approaches
