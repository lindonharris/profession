Thoughts – 4/21/2025

The capstone project of this phase of entrepreneurial experimentation. 

An entity designed to hold all my personal investments, aligning all of my business and investment interests to a long-term holding structure. Serves several other vital ends, including (1) legally shielding my personally-held assets (ie autos, properties, and other assets and cash for consumption) from business liabilities, (2) building my early track record as an asset manager, and (3) constructing a diversified portfolio of assets that can be used as collateral. Following incredible successes, my ultimate goal would be to contribute this nest egg to a family trust after deeper estate planning.

**Structure**

For now, all assets will live within the HoldCo with distinct ledgers for each owned asset. Personal assets (i.e. autos, homes, and cash/other assets intended for consumption) are held personally. As complexity develops, plan to ring-fence distinct strategies in sub-SPV structures and assign personal assets to a protective personal assets LLC. In the long-term:

[Highest Tier]

Dynasty Trust (Irrevocable)

       ↓

[Mid Tier]

Parent Holding LLC  

 (100% owned by Trust)

       ↓

[Lower Tier]

• SPV A – Startup Equity  

• SPV B – Private Debt  

• SPV C – Marketable Securities  

• Personal‑Use LLC (autos, residence)

**

**Taxation**

While the portion of net income intended for distribution to you is below $50k p.a., file taxes via Form 1040 Schedule C, which limits administrative burden (i.e. no payroll filings, no corporate tax returns). 

Once net profits sustainably exceed $50k, make an S-Corp election and pay yourself a "reasonable salary" subject to payroll taxes and not self-employment taxes. $50k is the breakeven point at which the tax savings from avoiding the self-employment tax might outweigh the cost to file payroll and corporate taxes.

**Materials Required**

The intention is to treat myself as an LP in my own fund. Compiling and maintaining these documents establishes rigorous governance, reporting, and compliance standards that facilitate leverage and ease of movement in the future.
