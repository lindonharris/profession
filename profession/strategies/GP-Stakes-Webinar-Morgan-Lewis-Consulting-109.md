**Minority Stakes in Alternative Asset Managers – Types of Deals**
- 
Alternatives firms sponsor hedge funds, private equity funds, private credit funds, and other private vehicles.

- 
There are four basic types of transactions making up the vast majority of deals done with alternatives firms:

- 
**Purchased stakes **in established managers to provide liquidity for their partners and/or growth capital (Dyal, Petershill, Blackstone SCH, sovereigns)

- 
Targets: private credit, real estate, and other illiquid and long-term lockup investments, not hedge funds due to duration risk

- 
Value prop: liquidity at attractive valuations (secondary), working capital, GP co-invests, or other growth initiatives (primary investment)

- 
Pricing: has increased significantly in the past few years, resulting in a median run-rate EBITDA multiple of 12x+ over the past three years

- 
Seed & stake transactions to launch new firms (e.g. Stable Asset Management-Harbourview)

- 
**

- 
Spin-outs of existing alts businesses from established financial services firms to form new managers (e.g. Neuberger Berman -> Dyal Capital)

- 
Institutionalization of stand-alone boutique managers to enhance their stability and franchise value (e.g. TPG-Sixth Street, Blackstone-GSO)

- 
GP stake transactions remain limited in Asia-Pacific, but this asset class appears likely to gain traction with the growth in the number of alternative firms in the region.
