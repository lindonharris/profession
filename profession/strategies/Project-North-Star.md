The "North Star" is self-mastery, the ultimate achievement if internal and external congruence. It is achieved by converging my desired identities—personal, professional, academic, entrepreneurial, etc.—into a cohesive unit realized through my thoughts, behaviors, and actions today.

The Project is a long-term thesis to achieve self-mastery. It requires an unwavering commitment to growth, reflection, patience, and the agency of the individual. 

The result is excellence and pride in that excellence. The maximization of returns to my own human capital, accrued to myself and the people and organizations I choose to serve.
