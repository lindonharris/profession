NB: Actual investment philosophy (and the resulting WIP IPS) will be the output of a customer discovery-driven fact-finding journey - see Fundraising Strategy. Below are valuable "pieces to the puzzle" collected along the way.

Mauboussin's Three Pillars of Investment Philosophy
- 
**Decision-making process is more important than short-term outcome.** “This emphasis is much easier announced than achieved because outcomes are objective while processes are more subjective. But a quality process, which often includes a large dose of theory, is the surest path to long-term success.”

- 
**Long-term perspective. **“ You simply cannot judge results in a probabilistic system over the short term because there is way too much randomness.”

- 
**A probabilistic approach. **“Psychology teaches us there are a lot of glitches in the probability module of our mental hardwiring… Proper investment philosophy helps us patch up some of these glitches, improving the chances of long-term success.”
