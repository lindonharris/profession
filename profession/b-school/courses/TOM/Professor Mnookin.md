8. **Offers constructive debate**: Respectful disagreement with reasoning

### Presenting Quantitative Analysis
Professor Mnookin's recommended approach:

2. **State the equation** - "Labor utilization = time used / time available"
3. **Then provide numbers** - "From Exhibit 2, this equals..."

### Comment Structure (The Triangle Method)
1. **Start with punchline** - "Company should do X"
2. **Outline logic** - "For two reasons: first... second..."
3. **Provide supporting detail** - Evidence and reasoning

## Course Management Style

### Assessment Philosophy
- **Engagement (40%)**: Quality over quantity, regular participation expected
- **Problem Sets (5%)**: Machine-graded for immediate feedback
- **Exams (55% total)**: Test application of concepts, not memorization

### Support Approach
