## üéØ DURING EXAM: Problem Type Quick Reference

### If question asks "What is the bottleneck?"
‚Üí **Quick Method**:
1. Calculate capacity of each step: Capacity = (# Resources √ó Time) / Processing Time
2. Find MINIMUM capacity = Bottleneck
3. System capacity = Bottleneck capacity

### If question asks "What is the throughput?"
‚Üí **Remember**: System throughput = Bottleneck rate (ALWAYS!)
‚Üí Ignore all other step capacities - they don't matter

### If question involves WIP, Flow Time, or Throughput Rate
‚Üí **Use Little's Law**: WIP = Throughput Rate √ó Flow Time
‚Üí Given any TWO, solve for the third
‚Üí **Common trap**: Flow Time = WIP / Rate (NOT WIP √ó Cycle Time!)

### If question is about a conveyor belt
‚Üí **Key insight**: Flow time is FIXED by belt speed
‚Üí WIP = Throughput Rate √ó (Belt Length / Belt Speed)
‚Üí Conveyor pace = bottleneck cycle time

### If question involves batches with setup times
‚Üí **Formula**: Total Time = Setup Time + (Run Time per Unit √ó Batch Size)
‚Üí **Watch for**: Bottleneck shifts with batch size
‚Üí Setup dominates small batches, run time dominates large batches

### If question asks about variability/blocking/starving
‚Üí **Check for overlap**: Do processing time ranges overlap with bottleneck?

**Quick Overlap Test Table**:

| Step Times | Overlap? | Effect | Actions That Help | Actions That DON'T Help |
|------------|----------|--------|-------------------|------------------------|
| A: 7, B: 8 | ‚ùå NO | Clear bottleneck (B) | Improve B | Train A, buffer anywhere |
| A: 7¬±2, B: 9¬±2 | ‚úÖ YES | Blocking/starving | Train A or B, buffer between A&B | Only improving B |
| A: 7¬±2, B: 6¬±3, C: 4¬±2, D: 10¬±1 | Check D vs others | D likely bottleneck | Check if D overlaps with C | Improve A, B, or C if no overlap |

**Decision Rules**:
- **No overlap** ‚Üí Predictable, OR = 1/CT bottleneck, buffer before bottleneck only
- **Overlap exists** ‚Üí Unpredictable, OR < 1/CT, buffer between overlapping steps to decouple

### If question asks "Should we invest in improving Step X?"
‚Üí **Decision tree**:
- Is X the current bottleneck? ‚Üí YES, invest
- Will X become bottleneck after first improvement? ‚Üí YES, invest
- Is X never a bottleneck at any volume/mix? ‚Üí NO, don't invest
- Does X variability cause blocking/starving? ‚Üí MAYBE, invest if impact significant

### If question asks "What happens when we ADD a new step to the process?"
‚Üí **Systematic Analysis** (check ALL impacts):

**Step 1**: Identify new bottleneck location
- Calculate capacity of new step
- Compare with existing bottleneck
- New bottleneck = MIN(new step, old bottleneck)

**Step 2**: Analyze metric changes

| Metric | Impact of Adding Step | Why |
|--------|----------------------|-----|
| **Bottleneck** | May shift if new step < old bottleneck capacity | New step could become constraint |
| **System Capacity** | Decreases if new step is slower than old bottleneck | System = MIN capacity |
| **Output Rate (OR)** | Stays same if new step > old bottleneck<br/>Decreases if new step < old bottleneck | OR = bottleneck rate |
| **Direct Labor Content (DLC)** | ALWAYS increases | Adding work = more labor |
| **Throughput Time (TPT) - No WIP** | Increases by new step time | Serial path gets longer |
| **Avg TPT - With WIP** | Increases even more | Buffers add waiting time |

**Example**: Add step (25 min/3 units = 8.33 min/unit)
- Old bottleneck: 10 min/unit (6 units/hr)
- New step: 8.33 min/unit (7.2 units/hr)
- **Result**: Bottleneck stays at old step (slower), OR unchanged at 6 units/hr
- **But**: DLC increases by 25 min, TPT increases

**CRITICAL INSIGHT**: Just because new step is faster than current bottleneck doesn't mean it has NO impact:
- ‚úÖ Output Rate: No change (correct)
- ‚ùå DLC: INCREASES (more total work)
- ‚ùå TPT: INCREASES (longer path + potential WIP)

### If question compares two processes (job shop vs. line flow)
‚Üí **Breakeven analysis**: When does setup cost equal time savings?
‚Üí **Example (Donner)**: Manual Time = CNC Setup + CNC Run Time

### If question asks about utilization
‚Üí **Formula**: Utilization = Demand / Capacity
‚Üí **Bottleneck utilization**: 100% (if demand ‚â• capacity)
‚Üí **Average utilization**: Total labor content / (# Workers √ó Cycle Time)

### If question involves time-varying input/output rates
‚Üí **Track WIP over time**: WIP accumulates when input > output
‚Üí **Maximum WIP**: Occurs at transition points (peak input or start of low input)
‚Üí **Average WIP**: Calculate area under curve √∑ time period

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

**These exam traps catch even well-prepared students:**

### 1. Little's Law Direction Confusion
‚ùå **WRONG**: "Flow Time = WIP √ó Cycle Time"
‚úÖ **RIGHT**: "Flow Time = WIP / Throughput Rate"

**Example trap**: 10 cars in system, 2 cars/hour throughput
- ‚ùå Wrong: 10 √ó 0.5 hr/car = 5 hours (backwards!)
- ‚úÖ Right: 10 / 2 = 5 hours per car

### 2. System Throughput ‚â† Average of Step Rates
‚ùå **WRONG**: "System throughput = average of all step capacities"
‚úÖ **RIGHT**: "System throughput = bottleneck rate ONLY"

**Why it matters**: System always runs at pace of slowest step, NOT average!

### 3. Improving Non-Bottlenecks Wastes Money
‚ùå **WRONG**: "Improve the step with lowest utilization"
‚úÖ **RIGHT**: "Improve current bottleneck or future bottleneck only"

**Trap**: Low utilization = plenty of capacity ‚Üí improvement doesn't help system!

### 4. Buffer Placement Matters
‚ùå **WRONG**: "Place buffers anywhere to absorb variability"
‚úÖ **RIGHT**: "Place buffers strategically based on variability and bottleneck location"

**Three Buffer Placement Rules:**

1. **Clear Bottleneck (No Overlap)**:
   - Place buffer RIGHT BEFORE bottleneck
   - Purpose: Protect bottleneck from upstream starvation
   - ‚ùå DON'T place after bottleneck (downstream never starves)

2. **Variability with Overlap**:
   - Place buffer BETWEEN overlapping steps to decouple the line
   - Purpose: Absorb variability, reduce blocking/starving
   - Example: If Steps 3 and 4 overlap, buffer between 3 & 4

3. **Conveyor-Paced Line**:
   - ‚ùå Cannot add buffers (WIP is fixed on belt)
   - WIP on belt IS the buffer

**Exam Decision Guide**: "Where should we place a buffer?"
1. Check for overlap ‚Üí If YES, place between overlapping steps (decouple)
2. If NO overlap ‚Üí Place before clear bottleneck (protect constraint)

### 5. Conveyor Belt Special Case
‚ùå **WRONG**: "WIP on conveyor depends on worker speed"
‚úÖ **RIGHT**: "Flow time is FIXED by belt speed; WIP = Rate √ó Fixed Flow Time"

**Trap**: Even if bottleneck speeds up, conveyor flow time stays constant!

### 6. Batch Size Changes Bottleneck
‚ùå **WRONG**: "Bottleneck stays same regardless of batch size"
‚úÖ **RIGHT**: "Bottleneck shifts: Small batches favor high setup, large batches favor high run time"

**Example (Fidget Spinner)**: Body is bottleneck at batch=30, Stickers at batch=70

### 7. Variability Reduces Capacity Even with Same Average
‚ùå **WRONG**: "If average times equal, throughput equal"
‚úÖ **RIGHT**: "Higher variability = more blocking/starving = lower effective capacity"

**Example (Airport Security)**: Lines A and B have same 25-sec average, but A has higher variability ‚Üí lower throughput

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION - Calculating Average Output Rate:**

| Scenario                                 | Can Calculate OR? | Formula                   | Why                                 |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Clear bottleneck (no overlap)**        | ‚úÖ YES             | OR = 1 / CT of bottleneck | Predictable system pace             |
| **No clear bottleneck (overlap exists)** | ‚ö†Ô∏è DIFFICULT      | Cannot use simple formula | Blocking/starving makes OR variable |

**Example Comparison**:
- **Process A**: Steps with variability causing overlap ‚Üí **Cannot easily calculate** average OR (unpredictable)
- **Process B**: Clear bottleneck (no overlap) ‚Üí **OR = 1/CT** of bottleneck (predictable)
- **Result**: Average OR of A < Average OR of B (even if bottleneck averages are equal!)

**Exam Trap**: "Calculate the average output rate"
- ‚ùå WRONG: Always use 1/CT of bottleneck
- ‚úÖ RIGHT: First check for overlap! If overlap exists, OR is lower than 1/CT

**[EXHIBIT 6 ALTERNATE: Variability and Throughput Relationship]**
*Could add visual showing how variability reduces throughput even with same averages*
*Optional exhibit location*

---

### 8. Utilization vs. Capacity Confusion
‚ùå **WRONG**: "High utilization means high capacity"
‚úÖ **RIGHT**: "High utilization means demand is close to capacity (could be low capacity!)"

**Trap**: Bottleneck is 100% utilized, but that's the CONSTRAINT, not a strength!

### 9. Ignoring Standard Assumptions
‚ùå **WRONG**: "Account for startup time and defects"
‚úÖ **RIGHT**: "Assume steady state, no defects, unlimited buffers UNLESS stated otherwise"

**Trap**: Over-complicating problems by adding factors not in assumptions!

### 10. Parallel Resources Capacity Calculation
‚ùå **WRONG**: "2 machines at 10 min/unit = 20 min capacity"
‚úÖ **RIGHT**: "2 machines at 10 min/unit = 10 min / 2 = 5 min per unit = 12 units/hr"

**Formula**: Divide processing time by number of parallel resources

---

## üîë Standard Exam Assumptions

**MEMORIZE THESE - They apply to ALL questions unless stated otherwise:**

1. ‚úÖ **Steady state** - Ignore start-up effects
2. ‚úÖ **No variability** - Processing times constant, workers don't speed up/slow down
3. ‚úÖ **No breakdowns** - Machines work perfectly, no maintenance needed
4. ‚úÖ **Unlimited buffers** - Unless size specified, buffers can hold any WIP amount
5. ‚úÖ **Zero travel time** - Transport between operations is instant
6. ‚úÖ **100% yield** - No defective units produced
7. ‚úÖ **Sufficient materials** - Initial operations never starved
8. ‚úÖ **No batch splitting** - Batches stay together, complete one step before advancing

> **Remember**: These assumptions hold UNLESS the question explicitly states otherwise

---

## üìê Essential Formulas for Cheat Sheet

### Little's Law (Most Important)
```
WIP = Throughput Rate √ó Flow Time
I = R √ó T

Rearranged:
- Flow Time (T) = WIP / Throughput Rate
- Throughput Rate (R) = WIP / Flow Time
```

**Common Mistake to Avoid**:
- ‚ùå WRONG: Flow Time = WIP √ó Cycle Time
- ‚úÖ CORRECT: Flow Time = WIP / Throughput Rate

### Capacity & Bottleneck
```
Capacity = (# Resources √ó Time Available) / Processing Time per Unit

System Capacity = Minimum capacity across all steps (bottleneck)

Utilization = Demand / Capacity

System Throughput = Bottleneck Rate (always!)
```

### Cycle Time
```
Cycle Time = 1 / Throughput Rate
(Time between unit completions)
```

### Conveyor Belt WIP
```
WIP = Throughput Rate √ó (Belt Length / Belt Speed)

Note: Flow time is FIXED on conveyors
```

### Batch Processing
```
Batch Processing Time = Setup Time + (Processing Time per Unit √ó Batch Size)

Batch Cycle Time = Batch Processing Time / Batch Size
```

### Process Metrics Summary
| Metric | Formula | Units |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Flow Time (T) | WIP / Throughput Rate | Time |
| Throughput Rate (R) | Units / Time | Units/Time |
| WIP (I) | R √ó T | Units |
| Cycle Time | 1 / R | Time/Unit |
| Utilization | Demand / Capacity | % |

---

## üéì Key Concepts from Cases

### Donner Company (PCB Manufacturing)
**Main Question**: Job shop vs line flow - when to use manual vs CNC drilling?

**Key Calculation**:
```
Breakeven Analysis:
Manual Time = CNC Setup + CNC Run Time
0.5 min/hole √ó N holes = 240 min + 0.08 min/hole √ó N holes
Breakeven = 500 holes

- Orders > 500 holes ‚Üí Use CNC (line flow)
- Orders < 500 holes ‚Üí Use manual (job shop)
```

**Key Insights**:
- Setup time dominates for small orders
- Different processes optimal for different volumes
- Bottleneck shifts with product mix
- High setup = favor large batches

### National Cranberry Cooperative
**Main Question**: Where is the bottleneck during peak harvest?

**Capacity Analysis**:
- Receiving: 5 dumpers √ó 75 bbls/hr = 375 bbls/hr
- Drying: 3 dryers √ó 200 bbls/hr = 600 bbls/hr
- Separating: 3 lines √ó 400 bbls/hr = 1,200 bbls/hr
- **Bottleneck**: Receiving (lowest capacity)

**Key Insights**:
- Bottleneck depends on product mix (wet/dry berry ratio)
- Seasonal capacity planning challenges
- Multiple improvement options with different costs

### Shad Process Flow Design
**Main Question**: How to map and analyze process flows?

**Key Skills**:
- Draw process flow diagrams
- Identify parallel vs sequential operations
- Calculate flow time through different paths
- Find critical path (longest flow time)

### Toyota Motor Manufacturing
**Main Question**: How does Toyota achieve quality and efficiency?

**Toyota Production System (TPS) Principles**:
- **Jidoka** (Autonomation): Build quality in, stop on defects
- **Andon Cord**: Any worker can stop the line
- **Poka-Yoke**: Error-proofing devices
- **Just-in-Time**: Right part, right time, right quantity
- **Continuous Flow**: Minimize WIP and inventory

**Key Insight**: Quality at the source prevents downstream problems

### Trouble at Tessei
**Main Question**: How to achieve excellence through Kaizen?

**Kaizen Principles**:
- **Continuous improvement**: Small, incremental changes
- **Employee involvement**: Front-line workers drive improvement
- **Standardization**: Document best practices
- **Visual management**: Make problems visible

**7-Minute Turnaround**:
- Reduced cleaning time from 12 min to 7 min
- Increased pride and ownership
- Transformed "undesirable" work into respected craft

## üîç CROSS-CASE PATTERNS & INSIGHTS

### Pattern 1: Bottleneck Identification is KING

**Across ALL cases, finding the bottleneck is the first step:**

| Case | Bottleneck Location | Why It Matters |
|------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Donner Company** | Shifts with order size (Manual drilling for small, other steps for large) | Different processes optimal for different volumes |
| **National Cranberry** | Receiving during peak (375 bbls/hr vs 600+ at other steps) | Seasonal demand creates different constraints |
| **Edison Motors** | Station 2 (240 sec) initially, then Station 5 after rebalancing | Line balancing can shift bottleneck |
| **Airport Security Q** | ID Check (always bottleneck, no overlap) | Clear bottleneck = predictable throughput |
| **Airport Security R** | ID Check (bottleneck with overlap) | Overlap creates blocking/starving |
| **Sample Problems** | Varies (T-shirt sewing, Body creation, etc.) | Always find MIN capacity first! |

**Key Insight**: **If you can identify the bottleneck in ANY problem, you're 70% of the way to the answer!**

---

### Pattern 2: Process Type Determines Strategy

**Process Selection Matrix from Cases:**

| Process Type | Volume | Variety | Setup Time | Example from Cases | Key Trade-off |
|-------------|--------|---------|------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Job Shop** | Low | High | Matters less | Donner small orders (manual drilling) | Flexibility vs efficiency |
| **Batch** | Medium | Medium | CRITICAL | Fidget Spinner (setup dominates small batches) | Batch size optimization |
| **Line Flow** | High | Low | High but amortized | Donner large orders (CNC), Edison Motors | Efficiency vs flexibility |
| **Conveyor-Paced** | High | Very Low | N/A | Edison Motors assembly line | Fixed pace, line balancing critical |

**Decision Rule**:
- **High variety, low volume** ‚Üí Job shop (flexible resources, general purpose equipment)
- **Medium variety/volume** ‚Üí Batch (balance setup vs run time)
- **Low variety, high volume** ‚Üí Line flow (dedicated resources, high efficiency)
- **Standardized product, very high volume** ‚Üí Conveyor (fixed pace, maximize balance)

---

### Pattern 3: Variability Always Hurts

**Variability impact across cases:**

| Case | Source of Variability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|---------------------|--------|------------|
| **National Cranberry** | Wet/dry berry ratio varies | Bottleneck location changes | Convert bins, add capacity |
| **Airport Security A** | ¬±5 sec at each step | Blocking/starving reduces throughput | Add buffers between steps |
| **Airport Security R** | Overlapping time ranges | Unpredictable bottleneck | Training to reduce variability |
| **Toyota/Tessei** | Process variation | Quality defects, inefficiency | Standardization, Jidoka, Kaizen |

**Key Principle**: **Even with identical averages, higher variability = lower throughput**

**Exam Pattern**: Look for questions comparing processes with same average times but different variability ‚Üí Lower variability wins!

![Managing Variability Examples](exhibits/EXHIBIT-6-Managing-Variability.png)

---

### Pattern 4: Investment Decisions Follow Same Logic

**Improvement investment framework (consistent across all cases):**

```
Should we invest in improving Step X?

‚îú‚îÄ Is X the current bottleneck?
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Invest! (increases system capacity)
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ After improving current bottleneck, does X become the new bottleneck?
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Invest! (prevents new constraint)
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ Is X NEVER a bottleneck at any product mix/batch size?
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Don't waste money! (no system impact)
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ Does X's variability cause blocking/starving at bottleneck?
   ‚îî‚îÄ MAYBE ‚Üí Invest only if quantifiable throughput impact
```

**Examples**:
- **NCC**: Invest in receiving (current bottleneck) or dryers (if wet berry % increases)
- **Fidget Spinner**: DON'T invest in bearings (never bottleneck at any batch size)
- **Edison Motors**: Invest in Station 2 (current) AND Station 5 (future after rebalancing)
- **Airport R**: Invest in training ID Check (reduces overlap blocking/starving)

### Pattern 5: Calculation Patterns Repeat

**Common calculation types across sample problems:**

| Calculation | Appears In | Formula | Common Trap |
|------------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **System Capacity** | ALL problems | MIN(all step capacities) | ‚ùå Don't average! |
| **Flow Time (first unit)** | Stuffed Animal, Shad | Longest path through process | Include all serial steps |
| **Labor Content** | Stuffed Animal, Edison | Sum ALL task times | ‚â† Flow time! |
| **Average Utilization** | Stuffed Animal, Edison | Labor / (Workers √ó Cycle Time) | Different from bottleneck util |

### Pattern 6: Common "Gotcha" Questions

**Questions that appear repeatedly in different disguises:**

1. **"Should we train Worker X?"**
   - ‚úÖ YES if X is bottleneck or creates variability that blocks bottleneck
   - ‚ùå NO if X is non-bottleneck with plenty of capacity

2. **"Will adding a worker increase output?"**
   - ‚úÖ YES if adding to bottleneck step
   - ‚ùå NO if adding to non-bottleneck (just increases idle time)

3. **"Which step should we NEVER upgrade?"**
   - ‚Üí Find step that's never bottleneck at any scenario (Fidget Spinner: Bearings)

4. **"What happens to throughput if we speed up Step X?"**
   - ‚úÖ Increases if X is bottleneck
   - ‚ùå No change if X is non-bottleneck

5. **"Compare Process A vs Process B - which has higher throughput?"**
   - ‚Üí Find bottleneck in each, compare bottleneck rates
   - ‚ùå Don't be fooled by average step times!

6. **"What's the flow time through the system?"**
   - **Parallel paths**: Take LONGEST path
   - **Serial steps**: Sum all step times
   - **Conveyor**: Length / Speed (fixed!)
   - **Using Little's Law**: WIP / Throughput Rate

### Problem 1: Stuffed Animal Production (Parallel Process with Bottleneck)

**Scenario**: 8-station production line, no buffers, specialized workers

```
Process Flow:
Material ‚Üí [Print wrapping] ‚Üí [Add price tag] ‚Üí Packaging
Prep ‚Üò     1 min/toy         0.05 min/toy       0.5 min/toy
1 min/toy
            [Shape/sew body] ‚Üí [Assemble toy] ‚Üó
            3 min/toy           0.8 min/toy

            [Prepare fiber] ‚Üó
            1.2 min/toy

            [Sew T-shirt] ‚Üó
            4 min/toy
```

**Key Calculations**:

| Question | Calculation | Answer |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Flow time (first unit)** | Longest path: 1 + 4 + 0.8 + 0.5 = 6.3 min | **6.3 minutes** |
| **System capacity** | Bottleneck = Sew T-shirt (4 min/toy)<br/>= 1/4 toy/min √ó 60 min/hr | **15 toys/hour** |
| **Labor content** | Sum all task times:<br/>1 + 1 + 0.05 + 3 + 1.2 + 4 + 0.8 + 0.5 | **11.55 minutes** |
| **Highest utilization** | Bottleneck worker: 4/4 = 100% | **100%** |
| **Average utilization** | 11.55 min / (8 workers √ó 4 min) = 11.55/32 | **36%** |

**Key Insights**:
- System paced by slowest step (bottleneck)
- Bottleneck worker is 100% utilized
- Other workers have idle time
- Training should focus on bottleneck and next-slowest steps
- Reducing non-bottleneck times doesn't increase capacity

### Problem 2: Fidget Spinner Production (Batch Processing & Setup Times)

**Scenario**: 3-step batch process with setup and run times, no buffers

| Step | Setup Time | Run Time | Notes |
|------|------------|----------|-------|
| Create Body | 45 min/batch | 0.1 min/unit | 1 machine |
| Insert Bearings | 25 min/batch | 0.5 min/unit | 2 machines (parallel) |
| Add Stickers | 10 min/batch | 0.7 min/unit | 1 machine |

**Bottleneck Analysis for 30-unit batches**:

| Step | Total Time | Calculation | Bottleneck? |
|------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Create Body | 48 min | 45 + (0.1 √ó 30) = 48 min | **YES (batch=30)** |
| Insert Bearings | 32.5 min | 25 + (0.5 √ó 30)/2 = 32.5 min | No |
| Add Stickers | 31 min | 10 + (0.7 √ó 30) = 31 min | No |

              Batch Size (units)

Intersection Points:
- Body = Stickers at 58.3 units ‚Üí Bottleneck switches here
- Body = Bearings at 133.3 units
- Bearings NEVER the bottleneck (always middle line)
```

**Key Calculations**:
- **Labor content** (batch of 30): Setup times only = 45 + 25 + 25 + 10 = **105 minutes**
  - Note: Run time is automated (no labor)
- **Capacity with batch=30**: 1/(48 min/30 units) = **37.5 units/hour**
- **Which step to never upgrade**: Insert Bearings (never bottleneck at any batch size)

**Key Insights**:
- Bottleneck shifts based on batch size
- Setup time dominates for small batches
- Run time dominates for large batches
- Graph analysis reveals which step is NEVER the bottleneck
- Only invest in upgrading actual bottlenecks

### Problem 3: Edison Motors Assembly (Conveyor-Paced Line)

**Scenario**: 5-station conveyor assembly line, 19 tasks assigned to 5 workers

| Station | Tasks | Total Time | Details |
|---------|-------|------------|---------|
| Station 1 | 1-3 | 115 sec | 80 + 25 + 10 |
| Station 2 | 4-7 | **240 sec** | 70 + 75 + 80 + 15 (BOTTLENECK) |
| Station 3 | 8-11 | 155 sec | 50 + 15 + 45 + 45 |
| Station 4 | 12-15 | 130 sec | 35 + 30 + 35 + 30 |
| Station 5 | 16-19 | 200 sec | 15 + 5 + 65 + 115 |

**Key Calculations**:

| Question | Calculation | Answer |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Labor content** | Sum all task times | **840 seconds/car** |
| **Throughput time** | 5 stations √ó 240 sec/station<br/>OR: WIP √ó CT = 5 √ó 240 | **1,200 seconds** |
| **Capacity** | 60 min/hr √∑ 4 min/car | **15 cars/hour** |
| **Labor utilization** | 840 / (5 workers √ó 240 sec) = 840/1200 | **70%** |

**Line Balancing Exercise**:
- **Current bottleneck**: Station 2 (240 sec)
- **Best task reallocation**: Move Task 4 (70 sec) to Station 1
  - Station 1: 115 + 70 = 185 sec
  - Station 2: 240 - 70 = 170 sec
  - **New bottleneck**: Station 5 (200 sec)
  - **New capacity**: 60 min √∑ 3.33 min = **18 cars/hour** (20% improvement!)

**Key Insights**:
- Conveyor pace = bottleneck cycle time
- All stations must wait for slowest station
- WIP is fixed (one car per station = 5 cars)
- Balancing tasks reduces idle time
- Perfect balance: All stations equal time = 840/5 = 168 sec ‚Üí 21.4 cars/hr capacity

### Problem 4: Airport Security (Variability & Blocking/Starving)

**Scenario**: 4-step security process, no buffers between steps

**Entry Line A vs B Comparison**:

| Step | Line A | Line B | Key Difference |
|------|--------|--------|----------------|
| Ticket/Gate | 25 ¬± 5 sec | 25 ¬± 3 sec | **Less variability in B** |
| ID Check | 25 ¬± 5 sec | 25 ¬± 3 sec | **Less variability in B** |
| Bag Inspection | 25 ¬± 5 sec | 25 ¬± 3 sec | **Less variability in B** |
| Pat Down | 25 ¬± 5 sec | 25 ¬± 3 sec | **Less variability in B** |

**Key Findings**:
- **Average time identical**: Both lines have 25 sec average at each step
- **Line B processes more passengers**: Less variability ‚Üí less blocking/starving
- **Adding buffer to Line A**: Increases throughput by reducing blocking/starving
  - Increases labor utilization (less idle time)

**Terminal 2 Analysis (Entry Line Q vs R)**:

| Step | Line Q | Line R | Bottleneck Analysis |
|------|--------|--------|---------------------|
| Ticket/Gate | 20 ¬± 7 | 22 ¬± 11 | Range: 13-27 vs 11-33 |
| **ID Check** | **38 ¬± 7** | **38 ¬± 7** | **Range: 31-45 (CRITICAL)** |
| Bag Inspection | 27 ¬± 3 | 28 ¬± 4 | Range: 24-30 vs 24-32 |
| Pat Down | 15 ¬± 4 | 14 ¬± 3 | Range: 11-19 vs 11-17 |

**Line Q Analysis**:
- ID Check (31-45 sec) NEVER overlaps with other steps
- ID Check is ALWAYS bottleneck ‚Üí avg cycle time = 38 sec
- **Training recommendation**: None (training non-bottleneck doesn't help)

**Line R Analysis**:
- ID Check (31-45 sec) OVERLAPS with:
  - Ticket/Gate (11-33 sec) ‚Üí causes starving
  - Bag Inspection (24-32 sec) ‚Üí causes blocking
- Overlap reduces throughput below 38 sec average
- **Training recommendation**: Train ID Check worker only
  - Eliminates variability ‚Üí removes overlap ‚Üí increases throughput

**Key Insights**:
- Variability reduces effective capacity
- Buffers mitigate blocking/starving
- No overlap in bottleneck times = predictable throughput
- Overlap in bottleneck times = reduced throughput
- Only train workers where variability causes overlap with bottleneck

### Problem 5: Apple Picking & Cider (WIP Accumulation Over Time)

**Scenario**: Workers deposit apples into bin, pressing machine processes at 100 kg/hr

**Daily Schedule**:
- 9am-12pm: 4 siblings √ó 50 kg/hr = 200 kg/hr input
- 12pm-1pm: No input (lunch break)
- 1pm-5pm: 1 sibling √ó 50 kg/hr = 50 kg/hr input
- After 5pm: Machine continues until bin empty

**WIP Accumulation Graph**:

```

    9am  11am  1pm  3pm  5pm  7pm  9pm

Net accumulation rates:
- 9am-12pm: +100 kg/hr (200 in - 100 out)
- 12pm-1pm: -100 kg/hr (0 in - 100 out)
- 1pm-5pm: -50 kg/hr (50 in - 100 out)
- 5pm+: -100 kg/hr (0 in - 100 out)
```

**Key Calculations**:

| Question | Calculation | Answer |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Total processed/day** | Morning: 600 kg<br/>Afternoon: 200 kg | **800 kg** |
| **Max WIP** | At noon: 3 hr √ó 100 kg/hr | **300 kg** |
| **Avg WIP** | Total kg-hours / operating hours<br/>1,100 kg-hr / 8 hr | **137.5 kg** |
| **Avg time in bin** | Little's Law: WIP / Rate<br/>137.5 kg / 100 kg/hr | **1.375 hours** |
| **Shutdown time** | With 150 kg extra at 1pm:<br/>(350 kg at 1pm - 200 kg by 5pm) / 100 kg/hr | **6:30pm** |

**kg-hours Calculation** (area under curve):
- 9am-12pm triangle: ¬Ω √ó 3 hr √ó 300 kg = 450 kg-hr
- 12pm-1pm: (1 hr √ó 200 kg) + (¬Ω √ó 1 hr √ó 100 kg) = 250 kg-hr
- 1pm-5pm triangle: ¬Ω √ó 4 hr √ó 200 kg = 400 kg-hr
- **Total**: 1,100 kg-hr √∑ 8 operating hours = 137.5 kg average

**Key Insights**:
- WIP accumulates when input > output
- WIP decreases when input < output
- Maximum WIP occurs at transition points
- Average WIP calculated as area under curve √∑ time
- Little's Law applies: Avg TPT = Avg WIP / Output Rate
- Adding workers increases total processed AND shutdown time

## üíé MARGINAL POINTS - Subtle Distinctions

**These fine points separate 90% from 95%+ performance:**

### 1. Flow Time vs. Throughput Time vs. Cycle Time
**CRITICAL distinctions that get confused:**

- **Flow Time (Throughput Time)**: Time ONE unit spends in system (start to finish)
  - Example: Car enters at 1pm, exits at 1:20pm ‚Üí Flow time = 20 minutes
- **Cycle Time**: Time BETWEEN unit completions (pace of output)
  - Example: Unit exits every 4 minutes ‚Üí Cycle time = 4 min/unit
- **Relationship**: Flow Time = WIP √ó Cycle Time (for steady state) OR Flow Time = WIP / Throughput Rate

**Common exam trap**: "10 cars on belt, exits every 2 minutes, what's flow time?"
- ‚ùå WRONG: 10 √ó 2 = 20 minutes
- ‚úÖ RIGHT: Depends on belt speed! If belt is 100m at 10m/min, flow time = 10 min (fixed by belt)

### 2. Labor Content ‚â† Flow Time
**Two completely different concepts:**

- **Labor Content**: SUM of all task times (total work per unit)
  - Example: 8 workers, tasks = 1+1+0.05+3+1.2+4+0.8+0.5 = 11.55 min
- **Flow Time**: Time unit spends in system (longest path)
  - Example: Same system, longest path = 1+4+0.8+0.5 = 6.3 min

**Why different**: Workers work in parallel! Flow time = longest path, not sum of all paths.

### 3. Average Utilization Calculation Trap
**WRONG method** (seems logical but incorrect):
- ‚ùå "Average utilization = average of all individual utilizations"

**CORRECT method**:
- ‚úÖ "Average utilization = Total Labor Content / (# Workers √ó Bottleneck Cycle Time)"
- Formula: Avg Util = (Sum of all task times) / (Workers √ó Cycle Time)

**Example**: 11.55 min labor / (8 workers √ó 4 min cycle) = 11.55/32 = 36%

### 4. Conveyor Belt Special Properties
**Conveyor ‚â† Regular serial process:**

| Property | Regular Process | Conveyor Process |
|---------|----------------|------------------|
| Flow Time | Can vary with WIP | FIXED by belt speed |
| WIP | Varies with throughput | Also varies, but uses fixed flow time |
| Bottleneck impact | Sets throughput | Also sets throughput, but flow time unchanged |
| Buffer placement | Can add between steps | WIP IS the buffer (fixed on belt) |

**Exam trap**: "Bottleneck speeds up on conveyor belt, what happens to flow time?"
- ‚ùå WRONG: "Flow time decreases"
- ‚úÖ RIGHT: "Flow time stays SAME (belt speed unchanged), throughput increases"

### 5. Parallel Resources Division (Not Multiplication!)
**Processing time with parallel resources:**

**WRONG approach**:
- ‚ùå "2 machines at 10 min/unit ‚Üí Total capacity = 2 √ó 10 = 20 min"

**CORRECT approach**:
- ‚úÖ "2 machines at 10 min/unit ‚Üí Effective time = 10 / 2 = 5 min/unit"
- ‚úÖ "Capacity = 60 min / 5 min/unit = 12 units/hour"

**Formula**: Effective Processing Time = Individual Time / # Parallel Resources

### 6. Batch Processing Bottleneck Shifts
**Not just which step is slowest, but which is slowest FOR THIS BATCH SIZE:**

**Example (Fidget Spinner)**:
- Create Body: 45 + 0.1√óN minutes
- Add Stickers: 10 + 0.7√óN minutes
- **Breakeven**: Set equal ‚Üí 45 + 0.1N = 10 + 0.7N ‚Üí N = 58.3 units

**Result**:
- Batches < 58 units ‚Üí Body is bottleneck
- Batches > 58 units ‚Üí Stickers is bottleneck
- Investment decision depends on typical batch size!

### 7. Variability Overlap Test
**How to test if variability matters:**

**Step 1**: Calculate range for each step
- Example: ID Check = 38 ¬± 7 ‚Üí Range: 31 to 45 seconds

**Step 2**: Compare ranges
- **No overlap**: Clear bottleneck (ID Check 31-45 vs Bag 24-30 ‚Üí NO overlap)
  - Result: Predictable throughput = 38 sec average
- **Overlap exists**: Blocking/starving occurs (ID Check 31-45 vs Ticket 11-33 ‚Üí OVERLAP at 31-33)
  - Result: Throughput < 38 sec average

**CRITICAL EXAM INSIGHTS - Overlap Decision Rules:**

| Scenario | Overlap? | Speeding Up Upstream Helps? | Buffer Helps? | Why |
|----------|----------|---------------------------|---------------|-----|
| **A: 7, B: 8** | ‚ùå NO | ‚ùå NO | ‚ùå NO | Clear bottleneck (B), no blocking/starving |
| **A: 7¬±2, B: 9¬±2** | ‚úÖ YES (ranges 5-9 and 7-11) | ‚úÖ YES | ‚úÖ YES | Overlap causes variability issues |
| **A: 7¬±2, B: 6¬±3, C: 4¬±2, D: 10¬±1** | Check D vs others | Depends on overlap with D | Only if overlap exists | D is bottleneck (highest avg) |

**Decision Logic**:
1. **No overlap with bottleneck** ‚Üí System has clear bottleneck
   - Output Rate = 1 / Cycle Time of bottleneck (predictable)
   - Speeding up non-bottleneck steps = NO impact
   - Buffers = NO help (bottleneck never starves)

2. **Overlap with bottleneck exists** ‚Üí Blocking/starving occurs
   - Output Rate < 1 / Cycle Time of bottleneck (unpredictable)
   - Speeding up overlapping steps = INCREASES output rate
   - Buffers = YES, help decouple the line (place between overlapping steps)

**Exam pattern**:
- "Should we train Worker A?" ‚Üí Check if A overlaps with bottleneck
- "Would buffer help?" ‚Üí YES only if overlap exists
- "Compare Process 1 vs Process 2 throughput" ‚Üí Check for overlap differences

### 8. WIP Accumulation Over Time
**When input rate ‚â† output rate:**

**Key formulas**:
- **Instantaneous WIP change**: Œî WIP = Input Rate - Output Rate
- **Maximum WIP**: Occurs at transitions (end of high input period)
- **Average WIP**: Area under WIP curve √∑ Total time

**Common trap**: "What's average WIP?"
- ‚ùå WRONG: (Max WIP + Min WIP) / 2 (only works if linear!)
- ‚úÖ RIGHT: Calculate area using geometry (triangles, rectangles)

**Example (Apple Picking)**:
- WIP graph creates triangles ‚Üí Use ¬Ω √ó base √ó height for each segment
- Total area = 450 + 250 + 400 = 1,100 kg-hours
- Average WIP = 1,100 / 8 hours = 137.5 kg

### 9. Investment "Never Worth It" Scenarios
**How to identify steps that should NEVER be upgraded:**

**Test across ALL scenarios**:
1. Graph processing time vs. batch size (or other variable)
2. Look for lines that NEVER cross at the lowest point
3. Those steps are never bottlenecks ‚Üí Never invest

**Example (Fidget Spinner)**:
- Bearings line is always BETWEEN Body and Stickers
- Bearings never bottleneck at ANY batch size
- Investment in bearings = wasted money!

### 10. Line Balancing Perfect State
**Theoretical perfect balance:**

**Formula**: Perfect Cycle Time = Total Labor Content / # Workers
- Example: 840 sec labor / 5 workers = 168 sec per worker

**Reality check**:
- Can you assign tasks to achieve this exactly? (Usually no, due to task indivisibility)
- **Best achievable**: Minimize the maximum station time
- **Capacity with perfect balance**: # Workers / (Labor Content / 60 min)

**Exam trap**: "What's maximum possible capacity?"
- ‚Üí Calculate perfect balance, even if task assignment doesn't allow it exactly

1. **The Bottleneck is KING**
   - System throughput = Bottleneck rate (always!)
   - System pace = Bottleneck cycle time
   - Improving non-bottlenecks doesn't increase system capacity

2. **Little's Law is UNIVERSAL**
   - WIP = Throughput Rate √ó Flow Time
   - Applies to entire system or individual steps
   - Given any 2 variables, you can find the 3rd
   - CRITICAL: Flow Time = WIP / Rate (NOT WIP √ó Cycle Time!)

3. **Variability Kills Performance**
   - Higher variability ‚Üí More blocking/starving ‚Üí Lower throughput
   - Even with identical averages, lower variability wins
   - Buffers mitigate variability impact (place before bottleneck!)

4. **Process Type Follows Volume-Variety Trade-off**
   - High variety, low volume ‚Üí Job shop (flexibility)
   - Medium variety, medium volume ‚Üí Batch (balance)
   - Low variety, high volume ‚Üí Line flow (efficiency)
   - Standard product, very high volume ‚Üí Conveyor (fixed pace)

### Investment & Improvement Principles

5. **Only Improve Bottlenecks (Current or Future)**
   - Current bottleneck ‚Üí Directly increases system capacity
   - Future bottleneck ‚Üí Prevents new constraint after first improvement
   - Never a bottleneck ‚Üí Waste of money (no system impact)

6. **Buffer Placement Matters**
   - ALWAYS place buffers RIGHT BEFORE bottlenecks
   - Buffers protect constraint from starvation
   - Buffers after bottleneck don't help (downstream never starves)

7. **Batch Size Optimization**
   - Small batches ‚Üí Setup time dominates
   - Large batches ‚Üí Run time dominates
   - Bottleneck can shift with batch size!
   - Find breakeven point where alternatives are equal

### Calculation Principles

8. **Capacity Calculation Rules**
   - Single resource: Capacity = Time Available / Processing Time
   - Parallel resources: Effective Time = Time / # Resources
   - System capacity = MIN(all step capacities) = Bottleneck capacity

9. **Time Distinctions**
   - Flow Time = time one unit spends in system (longest path)
   - Cycle Time = time between completions (1 / Throughput Rate)
   - Labor Content = sum of all task times (total work per unit)
   - These are THREE DIFFERENT things!

### Strategic Principles

10. **Continuous Improvement Philosophy (Kaizen)**
    - Small, incremental changes compound over time
    - Employee involvement crucial (front-line knows best)
    - Standardize current best practice, then improve
    - Visual management makes problems visible

11. **Quality at the Source (Jidoka)**
    - Build quality in, don't inspect it in
    - Anyone can stop the line (Andon cord)
    - Fix problems immediately, don't pass them downstream
    - Error-proofing (Poka-Yoke) prevents defects

12. **Just-in-Time Principle**
    - Right part, right time, right quantity
    - Minimize WIP and inventory
    - Pull system (downstream demand triggers upstream)

### Exam Strategy Principles

13. **Read Carefully and Identify Problem Type**
    - Multiple steps with times ‚Üí Find bottleneck
    - Given 2 of WIP/Rate/Time ‚Üí Use Little's Law
    - Setup + run time ‚Üí Batch processing
    - Conveyor mentioned ‚Üí Fixed flow time
    - Variability mentioned ‚Üí Check for overlap

14. **When in Doubt, Draw It Out**
    - Sketch the process flow
    - Label capacities at each step
    - Calculate bottleneck
    - Apply formulas systematically

**Remember**: These principles apply to ALL TOM problems. Master them and you'll recognize patterns instantly!

## üìù Cheat Sheet Suggestions

### Side 1: Formulas
```
LITTLE'S LAW: I = R √ó T
- Flow Time = WIP / Throughput
- Throughput = WIP / Flow Time

CAPACITY: (Resources √ó Time) / Processing Time
Utilization = Demand / Capacity
Cycle Time = 1 / Throughput Rate

BOTTLENECK: Minimum capacity step
System Capacity = Bottleneck Capacity
System Throughput = Bottleneck Rate

CONVEYOR: WIP = Rate √ó (Length / Speed)
```

### Side 2: Key Concepts
- 8 Standard Assumptions
- Process types: Job Shop, Batch, Line, Continuous
- Volume-Variety relationship
- Buffer placement: RIGHT BEFORE bottlenecks
- TPS principles: Jidoka, Just-in-Time, Andon
- 7 Wastes (TIMWOOD)
- Kaizen principles

### Common Mistakes to Include
- ‚ùå Flow Time ‚â† WIP √ó Cycle Time
- ‚úÖ Flow Time = WIP / Throughput
- ‚úÖ System pace = Bottleneck rate (always!)
- ‚úÖ Buffers BEFORE bottlenecks (not after)
