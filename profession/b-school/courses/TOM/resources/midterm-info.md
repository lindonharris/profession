Unless stated otherwise, assume:

2. **No variability**: Processing times have negligible variability, workers neither speed up nor slow down
3. **No breakdowns**: No machine breakdowns or maintenance breaks
4. **Large buffers**: Buffers large enough to accommodate any WIP under normal operations (unless sizes specified)
5. **No travel time**: Travel time and transport time are negligible
6. **100% yield**: Operations produce no defective units
7. **No starvation**: Sufficient parts/raw materials, initial operations never starved
8. **Batch processing**: Batches cannot be split among workstations (even if same function) unless stated; each batch completely processed through one step before advancing

**Remember: These assumptions hold unless stated otherwise**
