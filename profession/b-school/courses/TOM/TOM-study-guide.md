## üè≠ Core Operations Frameworks

### 1. Process Analysis Fundamentals

#### Process Metrics
| Metric | Formula | Units | Interpretation |
|--------|---------|-------|----------------|
| **Flow Time (T)** | Time from start to finish | Time | Total time in system |
| **Throughput Rate (R)** | Units completed / Time period | Units/Time | System output rate |
| **Work-in-Process (WIP)** | Units in system | Units | Inventory in process |
| **Cycle Time (CT)** | Time between unit completions | Time/Unit | Pace of production |
| **Utilization (U)** | Actual output / Capacity | % | Resource usage |
| **Efficiency** | Standard time / Actual time | % | Performance vs standard |

#### Little's Law
**WIP = Throughput Rate √ó Flow Time**
```
I = R √ó T
```

Applications:
- Restaurant: Customers = Arrival Rate √ó Time in Restaurant
- Hospital: Patients = Admission Rate √ó Length of Stay
- Factory: Inventory = Production Rate √ó Lead Time

### 2. Process Types & Characteristics

#### Process Archetypes
| Type | Volume | Variety | Examples | Characteristics |
|------|--------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| **Job Shop** | Low | High | Custom furniture, R&D | Flexible, high skill, high cost/unit |
| **Batch** | Medium | Medium | Bakery, Pharmaceuticals | Some standardization, setup times |
| **Line Flow** | High | Low | Auto assembly, Fast food | Standardized, efficient, inflexible |
| **Continuous** | Very High | Very Low | Oil refining, Chemicals | Capital intensive, 24/7 operation |

#### Product-Process Matrix
```
         Low Volume          High Volume
         High Variety        Low Variety

High    | Job Shop  ‚Üí  Batch Process |
Flex    |     ‚Üò              ‚Üò      |
        | (Off diagonal = inefficient)|
Low     | Batch  ‚Üí  Line  ‚Üí  Continuous|
Flex    |                            |
```

### 3. Capacity Analysis

#### Bottleneck Identification
1. **Calculate capacity** of each step: Units/Time
2. **Find minimum capacity** = Bottleneck
3. **System capacity** = Bottleneck capacity
4. **Utilization** = Demand / Capacity

#### Capacity Calculations
```
Capacity = (# Resources √ó Time Available) / Processing Time per Unit

Effective Capacity = Theoretical Capacity √ó Availability √ó Performance √ó Quality
                   = Theoretical √ó OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness)
```

#### Theory of Constraints (TOC)
1. **Identify** the constraint (bottleneck)
2. **Exploit** the constraint (maximize utilization)
3. **Subordinate** everything to the constraint
4. **Elevate** the constraint (add capacity)
5. **Repeat** (find new constraint)

### 4. Variability & Uncertainty Management

#### Sources of Variability
- **Arrival variability**: Customer demand patterns
- **Processing variability**: Task time variations
- **Resource variability**: Machine breakdowns, worker absence

#### Impact of Variability
**Kingman's Formula** (VUT Equation):
```
Average Wait Time = (V √ó U √ó T)

Where:
V = Variability factor (CV¬≤arrival + CV¬≤process)/2
U = Utilization (œÅ = Œª/Œº)
T = Average processing time
```

Higher variability ‚Üí Longer queues ‚Üí Lower effective capacity

#### Buffering Strategies
1. **Inventory buffers**: Safety stock
2. **Capacity buffers**: Extra resources
3. **Time buffers**: Lead time padding

## üìä Operations Analysis Toolkit

### 1. Process Flow Diagramming

#### Standard Symbols
```
‚óã = Start/End
‚ñ° = Process/Activity
‚óá = Decision
‚ñ≥ = Inventory/Storage
‚Üí = Flow direction
‚ü≥ = Rework loop
```

#### Process Mapping Steps
1. **Define boundaries**: Start and end points
2. **List activities**: All process steps
3. **Sequence activities**: Order and dependencies
4. **Add decision points**: Where flow splits
5. **Identify resources**: Who/what performs each step
6. **Measure metrics**: Time, cost, quality at each step

### 2. Queueing Theory Basics

#### M/M/1 Queue (Single Server)
```
Arrival rate: Œª
Service rate: Œº
Utilization: œÅ = Œª/Œº (must be < 1)

Average # in system (L): œÅ/(1-œÅ)
Average # in queue (Lq): œÅ¬≤/(1-œÅ)
Average time in system (W): 1/(Œº-Œª)
Average wait time (Wq): œÅ/(Œº-Œª)
```

#### M/M/c Queue (Multiple Servers)
- More complex formulas
- Lower wait times than c separate M/M/1 queues
- Pooling benefit from shared queue

### 3. Inventory Management

#### Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)
```
EOQ = ‚àö(2DS/H)

Where:
D = Annual demand
S = Setup/ordering cost
H = Holding cost per unit per year

Total Cost = (D/Q)S + (Q/2)H + DC
```

#### Newsvendor Model
```
Critical Ratio = (Price - Cost)/(Price - Salvage Value)
               = Cu/(Cu + Co)

Order quantity where: P(Demand ‚â§ Q*) = Critical Ratio
```

#### Safety Stock
```
Safety Stock = z √ó œÉ √ó ‚àöL

Where:
z = Service level z-score
œÉ = Demand standard deviation
L = Lead time
```
