# Student Success at Georgia State University (A)

## Quick Facts
- **Case #**: 9-621-006
- **Course**: [[TOM]]
- **Class #**: 8
- **Date Read**: 2025-10-05
- **Industry**: Higher Education
- **Geography**: Atlanta, Georgia

## Executive Summary
Georgia State University increased its six-year graduation rate by 69% (from 32% to 54%) over 10 years while simultaneously eliminating graduation rate disparities by race, ethnicity, and income—all while growing undergraduate enrollment by a third to 25,000+ students. In early 2016, Student Success leaders face a new challenge: "summer melt" has nearly doubled to 18.5%, with disproportionate impact on low-income and minority students.

## Case Context

- **2005**: Six-year graduation rate was 32%
- **2009**: Mark Becker became president; Great Recession; $40M budget cuts over 3 years; Tim Renick became VP for Enrollment and Student Success
- **2011**: Became #1 conferrer of bachelor's degrees to African Americans (nonprofit)
- **2012**: Summer melt was 10.9% of incoming class
- **2015**:
  - Six-year graduation rate: 54% (69% increase from 2005)
  - Eliminated graduation rate gaps by race, ethnicity, income
  - Summer melt reached 18.5% (nearly doubled from 2012)

- **Scott Burke**: Assistant Vice President of Admissions
  - Background: Admissions data analysis
  - Key decisions: Identified and reported summer melt trends to leadership

## Central Problem/Decision

### The Question
What should Georgia State do to address the rising "summer melt" phenomenon where admitted students who confirm enrollment fail to actually enroll?

### Constraints
1. Disproportionate impact on students of color, low-income, and first-generation students
2. 1/3 of "melt" students not enrolling anywhere (complete dropout from higher ed)
3. Need to maintain commitment to access and equity
4. Resource limitations from budget cuts
5. Must not compromise graduation rate improvements already achieved
6. Scale challenge: 25,000+ students

### Success Metrics
- Reduction in summer melt percentage
- Equitable outcomes across demographic groups
- Actual enrollment rates of confirmed admits
- Retention of first-generation and low-income students
- Maintaining six-year graduation rates (54%)
- Maintaining equity in graduation outcomes

## Analysis

### Strengths
- Proven track record of data-driven process improvement
- 69% increase in graduation rates (32% → 54%) over 10 years
- Eliminated graduation gaps by race, ethnicity, income
- Strong leadership commitment (President Becker, Renick, Calhoun-Brown)
- Student Success team with dedicated resources
- National recognition for innovation
- Culture prioritizing student success
- Existing predictive analytics capabilities
- Experience serving diverse, low-income, first-generation students

### Weaknesses
- Summer melt nearly doubled (10.9% → 18.5%) in 3 years
- 800 students lost in 2015 cohort alone
- Limited visibility into root causes of summer melt
- Potential gaps in communication or support during summer months
- May lack processes to maintain engagement post-acceptance
- Financial aid complexity may create barriers

### Opportunities
- Apply proven data analytics approach to summer melt problem
- Extend student support earlier (pre-enrollment)
- Leverage existing relationships with state government
- Create evidence-based interventions
- Address systemic barriers to enrollment
- Potential to influence sector-wide practices
- Additional national recognition for solving summer melt

### Threats
- Losing talented students to non-enrollment entirely
- Undermining equity gains if melt affects minority/low-income disproportionately
- Potential negative impact on university reputation
- Resource constraints from earlier budget cuts
- Competitor institutions may be targeting same students
- Systemic barriers (financial, informational) may be beyond university control

## Discussion Questions
1. How would you approach evaluating how successful Georgia State's Student Success efforts have been?
2. What should Georgia State do to address the rising "summer melt"?
3. What aspects of Georgia State's efforts do you think could be effectively deployed to improve operational performance at an organization at which you have worked?

## My Analysis & Recommendations

### Option 1: Proactive Summer Outreach & Support Program
**Pros**:
- Addresses root cause: lack of engagement/support during summer
- Leverages existing predictive analytics capabilities
- Can target high-risk students (low-income, first-generation, minority)
- Relatively low cost compared to revenue loss
- Scalable with technology (chatbots, automated reminders)

**Cons**:
- Requires new processes and potentially new staff
- May not address underlying financial or logistical barriers
- Success depends on student responsiveness during summer
- Timing challenge (students already admitted, limited window)

### Option 2: Financial Aid & Enrollment Simplification
**Pros**:
- Addresses potential complexity barriers
- Reduces friction in enrollment process
- May reveal hidden financial obstacles
- Could prevent dropout before it happens
- Aligns with equity mission

**Cons**:
- May require significant financial resources
- Complex to implement (financial aid regulations, systems)
- May not solve all root causes of melt
- Limited short-term impact if process takes time

### Option 3: Data-Driven Root Cause Analysis First
**Pros**:
- Follows Georgia State's proven methodology
- Identifies specific interventions needed
- Avoids wasted resources on wrong solutions
- Can segment by student type for targeted approaches
- Evidence-based approach aligns with culture

**Cons**:
- Delays action while data is collected/analyzed
- Another cohort may be lost during analysis
- May reveal problems beyond university's control
- Resource-intensive to conduct properly

### Recommended Action
**Implement immediate outreach while conducting parallel root cause analysis**

**Rationale**:
- Can't afford to lose another 800 students while studying problem
- Proven track record suggests data-driven approach will work
- Hybrid approach balances urgency with thoroughness
- Aligns with Georgia State's culture of evidence-based innovation

### Implementation Plan
1. **Immediate (Summer 2016)**:
   - Deploy targeted outreach to confirmed admits showing melt risk factors
   - Assign advisors to high-risk students for personal contact
   - Implement automated reminder system for enrollment steps
   - Create peer mentor program (current students reaching out)

2. **Short-term (Fall 2016-Spring 2017)**:
   - Conduct root cause analysis via surveys, interviews, data analysis
   - Identify specific barriers (financial, logistical, informational)
   - Test small interventions and measure impact
   - Engage with students who melted to understand their decisions

3. **Medium-term (2017-2018)**:
   - Build evidence-based intervention program based on findings
   - Integrate summer support into existing Student Success infrastructure
   - Create financial support mechanisms if cost is key barrier
   - Simplify enrollment processes based on identified friction points
