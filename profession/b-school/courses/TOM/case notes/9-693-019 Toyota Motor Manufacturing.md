# Toyota Motor Manufacturing, U.S.A., Inc.

## Quick Facts
- **Case #**: 9-693-019
- **Course**: [[TOM]]
- **Class #**: 7
- **Date Read**: 2025-10-05
- **Industry**: Automotive Manufacturing
- **Geography**: Georgetown, Kentucky, USA

## Executive Summary
On May 1, 1992, Doug Friesen (Assembly Manager at Toyota's Georgetown, KY plant) faces a critical decision: how to solve growing seat installation problems that are causing cars to sit off-line with defective or missing seats. The problem is urgent as sales approach plant capacity, but solving it could hurt line utilization—a key tension between TPS principles and operational realities.

## Case Context

### Company Background
**Toyota Production System (TPS) Origins**:
- Post-WWII Japan: People couldn't afford cars even at cost
- Labor productivity 1/8 of U.S. levels
- Challenge: Cut costs dramatically without U.S. scale economies
- Goal: "Better cars for more people" with variety, quality, timeliness, affordable price
- TPS evolved as Toyota's answer—common frame of reference for all employees

**Georgetown Plant (TMM)**:
- 1985: Toyota unveiled $800M greenfield plant plan in Kentucky
- "Live experiment" to transplant TPS to U.S. ("Bluegrass Country")
- July 1988: Began volume production on 1,300-acre site near Lexington
- Initial capacity: 200,000 Camry sedans/year (replacing Japanese imports)
- 1992: Expected to supply 240,000 all-new Camrys (sales up 20%+ since fall 1991 model change)
- March 1992: Started producing Camry wagon versions exclusively for worldwide network
- Midsize family sedan market: 1/3 of total U.S. car market, 17% pretax profit margin, $18,500 avg sticker price

### Industry Landscape
**Early 1980s Context**:
- Japanese automakers contemplating N. American production
- Japan's huge trade imbalance → political pressure
- Rapidly rising yen improved economic feasibility
- Unclear if cars produced outside Japan could maintain quality/cost reputation
- Question unresolved when Toyota announced Georgetown plant

### Timeline of Events
- **Early 1986**: Construction underway; hiring/training program initiated
  - Month-long trips to Tsutsumi plant in Japan for core personnel
  - Doug Friesen: "I built cars at Tsutsumi, and couldn't believe 60% of what I saw"
- **July 1988**: Georgetown plant began volume production
- **Fall 1991**: All-new Camry model launched (sales up 20%+)
- **March 1992**: Began producing Camry wagon versions
- **May 1, 1992 (Friday before Kentucky Derby)**:
  - Team members cheering "no overtime for the shift"
  - Plant hectic: brisk Camry sedan sales + ramping up wagons for Europe & N. America
  - Overtime earlier in week to make up lost production (below projected line utilization)
  - Growing number of cars off-line with defective/missing seats
  - Morning: Urgent meeting called by Mike DaPrile (GM of Assembly)
  - Afternoon: Friesen spent time on shop floor investigating
  - End of day: Clear seat problem needs solving, but could hurt line utilization

## Key Protagonists
- **Doug Friesen**: Manager of Assembly
  - Key decisions: Must choose how to solve seat problem without compromising line utilization
  - Challenge: First tough TPS question, "especially delicate"

- **Mike DaPrile**: General Manager of Assembly Plant
  - Called urgent meeting May 1, 1992 about seat problem

## Central Problem/Decision

### The Question
As Doug Friesen, what should you do to address the seat problem?

### Constraints
1. Sales approaching plant capacity (can't afford production disruptions)
2. Line utilization already below projected target (had overtime earlier in week)
3. TPS principles require immediate problem resolution (jidoka)
4. Solving problem could further hurt line utilization
5. Cars sitting off-line with defective/missing seats (growing problem)
6. Derby weekend approaching (team deserves break after hectic week)

### Success Metrics
- Line utilization rate (meeting production targets)
- Quality (no defective seats, no cars off-line)
- Adherence to TPS principles (jidoka, JIT, kaizen)
- Team morale and sustainable operations
- Customer satisfaction (flawless quality, perfect timing)

## Analysis

### Strengths (TPS System)
- **JIT principle**: Produce only what's needed, when needed, how much needed
- **Jidoka principle**: Make problems instantly self-evident, stop when detected
- **Visual control**: Andon cord/boards expose problems immediately
- **Kanban system**: Pull-based production from downstream actual usage
- **Human infrastructure**: "Good Thinking, Good Products"
- **Systematic problem-solving**: "Five Whys" to root cause
- **Kaizen culture**: Continuous improvement, proactive standard demolition
- **Deliberate ramp-up**: Slow schedule allowed learning from Tsutsumi

### Weaknesses
- System extremely prone to shutdowns (requires capable problem-solvers)
- High dependency on human capability to solve exposed problems promptly
- Tension between stopping line (jidoka) and maintaining utilization
- Transplanting TPS to U.S. unproven ("60% couldn't believe")
- Supplier quality issues can cascade through JIT system

### Opportunities
- Seat problem exposes systemic issue to address permanently
- Kaizen opportunity to improve process proactively
- Chance to reinforce TPS culture and problem-solving capability
- Learning opportunity for Georgetown team
- Can leverage Tsutsumi experience for similar problems

### Threats
- Line utilization already below target (production shortfalls)
- Sales at capacity—can't afford further disruptions
- Compromising TPS principles could undermine culture
- Quick fixes might mask root cause
- Team morale risk if Derby weekend disrupted

## My Analysis & Recommendations

### Question 1: Principal Elements of TPS

**Two Guiding Principles**:
1. **Just-In-Time (JIT)**: Produce only what's needed, how much needed, when needed
   - Pull system (from downstream actual usage vs. push from planned schedule)
   - Flowing production process
   - Minimal setup times for changeovers
   - Eliminates waste of overproduction

2. **Jidoka**: Make problems instantly self-evident, stop when problems detected
   - Build quality into production process
   - Visual control tools (andon cord/boards)
   - Normal state well-characterized and standardized
   - Immediate problem detection

**Prerequisites**:
- Standardized processes with plain documentation
- Flowing production (minimize setup times)
- Capable suppliers and parts flow

**Human Infrastructure**:
- "Good Thinking, Good Products" (corporate slogan)
- Systematic problem-solving: Five Whys to root cause
- "Let's go see it" (fact-based)
- Kaizen mindset: Continuous improvement, proactive change
- Senior management coaching and internal training

**Waste Elimination**:
- Core goal: Cost reduction through eliminating waste
- Example: Overproduction → inventory → warehouses → forklifts → handlers → computers → staff → wrong equipment investment

### Question 2: Andon Cord Purpose & Application

**Purpose**:
- Empowers workers to stop production line when problems detected
- Makes quality issues immediately visible (andon boards)
- Prevents defects from moving downstream
- Exposes systemic problems for resolution

**How It Works**:
- Worker pulls cord when problem detected
- Signals problem to entire team via board
- Line stops if problem not resolved quickly
- Team swarms to solve root cause
- Production resumes only when fixed

**Application to Other Organizations**:
- Software development: CI/CD pipeline failures stop deployments
- Healthcare: Anyone can call "time out" in OR for safety concerns
- Customer service: Escalation paths to resolve issues before proceeding
- Manufacturing: Quality gates that halt production for defects
- Key: Psychological safety + problem-solving capability

### Question 3: Kaizen Event Prerequisites

**Practical Requirements**:
- Standardized baseline process (know current state)
- Data/metrics to measure improvement
- Time allocated for team to focus
- Physical workspace for problem-solving
- Tools and resources available
- Authority to implement changes

**Organizational Requirements**:
- Management support and participation
- Culture valuing continuous improvement
- Blame-free environment (focus on process, not people)
- Cross-functional team participation
- Systematic problem-solving training (Five Whys)
- "Let's go see it" mentality (gemba)
- Willingness to demolish current standards proactively

### Question 4: Recommendation for Doug Friesen

**Immediate Action (This Week)**:
1. **Pull the andon cord metaphorically**: Acknowledge the problem openly
2. **Go to gemba**: Spend more time on floor observing seat installation
3. **Assemble cross-functional team**: Assembly, seat supplier, quality, logistics
4. **Five Whys exercise**: Get to root cause of seat defects
   - Why are seats defective? (symptoms)
   - Why is that happening? (proximate causes)
   - Keep asking until root cause identified

**Short-term (Next 2 Weeks)**:
5. **Conduct Kaizen event**: Dedicate focused time to solve systematically
6. **Evaluate supplier quality**: Is this supplier capability or process issue?
7. **Review JIT delivery**: Are timing/sequencing issues causing problems?
8. **Document standard**: What is the current process? Where does it fail?

**Rationale**:
- **Stop the bleeding**: Can't continue accumulating off-line cars
- **TPS integrity**: Compromising jidoka undermines entire system
- **Long-term thinking**: Short-term line utilization hit is worth permanent fix
- **Cultural moment**: How leadership responds signals TPS commitment
- **Root cause focus**: Quick fixes will fail; need systematic solution

**What NOT to Do**:
- ❌ Ignore problem to maintain line utilization (violates jidoka)
- ❌ Quick workaround without root cause analysis
- ❌ Blame individuals rather than fixing process
- ❌ Add inspection rather than building in quality
- ❌ Increase inventory buffers (violates JIT)

**Trade-off Acceptance**:
- Accept short-term line utilization impact
- Better to solve once correctly than repeatedly patch
- Reinforces TPS culture and problem-solving capability
- Demonstrates "Good Thinking" leads to "Good Products"
