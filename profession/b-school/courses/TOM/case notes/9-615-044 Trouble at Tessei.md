# Trouble at Tessei

## Quick Facts
- **Case #**: 9-615-044
- **Course**: [[TOM]]
- **Date Read**: 2025-10-05
- **Industry**: Transportation/Railway Services
- **Geography**: Japan

## Executive Summary
In August 2005, Teruo Yabe was appointed to lead a turnaround at Tessei, a struggling JR East subsidiary responsible for cleaning Shinkansen bullet trains at Tokyo Station. With only 7 minutes per train to complete cleaning operations, Tessei faced mounting safety issues, operational mistakes, customer complaints, and employee turnover—all while JR East increased service frequency and cut commission fees.

## Case Context

### Company Background
- **Founded**: 1952 to clean train cars on Japanese National Railways
- **Current Status**: Subsidiary of JR East (since 1987 privatization)
- **Primary Objective**: Clean JR East's Shinkansen trains
- **Revenue Model**: Commission fees from JR East
- **Workforce**: 669 employees (2005), 52% part-time (346 workers)
- **Average Employee Age**: 53 years old
- **Recruitment Challenge**: Train cleaning considered "3K" job (kitanai/dirty, kitsui/difficult, kiken/dangerous)

### Industry Landscape
- **Shinkansen System**: Most ridden high-speed rail network globally (325M passengers/year in 2005)
- **JR East Share**: 39% of total ridership (127M passengers across 5 lines)
- **Operating Speed**: Up to 320 km/h (200 mph)
- **Punctuality Standard**: Average arrival within 6 seconds of schedule (2003)
- **Service Frequency**: Trains sometimes operate only 3 minutes apart

### Timeline of Events
- **1952**: Tessei founded
- **1987**: JR privatization; Tessei becomes JR East subsidiary
- **Early 2000s**: Managerial misconduct leads to fee reduction
- **2001-2005**:
  - Revenue declined 12% (¥3,137M → ¥2,749M)
  - Cars cleaned per day increased 12% (1,904 → 2,127)
  - Accidents increased 6x (3 → 18 incidents)
  - Part-time employees increased (188 → 346)
  - Customer complaints rising
- **2005**: Yabe hired to lead turnaround

## Key Protagonists
- **Teruo Yabe**: Director and General Manager of Tessei
  - **Background**: 39-year career at JR East in safety, operations, and management; reached retirement age
  - **Previous Roles**: Safety policy, transport management (Tokyo/Yokohama branches), stationmaster
  - **Challenge**: No background in cleaning; sent to "troubled" subsidiary via Amakudari
  - **Approach**: Spent first 30 days working alongside front-line employees

## Central Problem/Decision

### The Question
> As the newly appointed leader of Tessei, which operational and organizational levers should Teruo Yabe pull first to reverse the company's decline in quality, timeliness, safety, customer satisfaction, and employee morale?

### Constraints
1. **Extreme Time Pressure**: Only 7 minutes per train (12-minute total station time minus passenger boarding/disembarking)
2. **Limited Budget**: Commission fees reduced by 12% while workload increased 12%
3. **Workforce Challenges**:
   - High turnover (hiring 20-30 part-time workers monthly)
   - Difficult recruiting environment (stigmatized "3K" work)
   - Employees with challenging career histories
4. **Complex Operations**:
   - Non-standardized trains (6-17 car configurations)
   - Multiple car types (regular, first-class, business, two-story)
   - Variable platform positions
5. **Increasing Demand**: JR East continuously increasing departure frequency
6. **Safety Crisis**: Accidents increased from 3 (2001) to 18 (2005)

### Success Metrics
- Reduction in safety incidents and operational mistakes
- Decrease in customer complaints
- Improved employee retention and satisfaction
- Meeting 7-minute cleaning deadlines consistently
- Better quality of cleaning (bathrooms, forgotten items)

## Analysis

### Strengths
- **Standardized Processes**: Detailed Cleaning Manual with specific procedures
- **Experienced Leader**: Yabe brings 39 years of JR East operational/safety expertise
- **Infrastructure**: Dedicated facilities beneath platforms (Exhibits 15-16)
- **Clear Expectations**: Well-defined cleaning tasks and quality standards
- **Team Structure**: 22-person crews with defined roles

### Weaknesses
- **Employee Morale**: Workers feel discriminated against, restricted, and scared of management
- **Command-and-Control Culture**: "Taiikukai-kei" culture stifles initiative and customer service
- **Safety Record**: 6x increase in accidents (2001-2005)
- **Quality Issues**: Rising complaints about untidy bathrooms, forgotten items
- **Turnover**: Extremely high (20-30 new hires monthly needed)
- **Cost Pressure**: Forced to increase part-time workers despite benefit tradeoffs
- **Process Inefficiencies**: Employees deviating from procedures to meet deadlines
- **Resource Constraints**: Soap quotas, inadequate supplies

### Opportunities
- **Process Improvement**: Employees already identifying workarounds (suggests optimization potential)
- **Employee Engagement**: Workers want to help customers but feel restricted

## Discussion Questions

1. **To your mind, what caused the challenges Tessei is facing?**

2. **What would you, as Yabe, do to overcome them? The exhibits provide detailed information that may prove useful in your analysis.**

## My Analysis & Recommendations

### Root Causes of Tessei's Challenges

**Operational Factors**:
- Increasing workload (+12% cars) with declining resources (-12% revenue)
- Shift to part-time labor creating continuity/training challenges
- Complex, non-standardized operations (variable train configurations)
- Extreme time constraints (7 minutes) with no margin for error

**Organizational/Cultural Factors**:
- Command-and-control culture ("taiikukai-kei") stifling initiative
- Employees prohibited from customer service, creating disconnect from mission
- Fear-based management (yelling, intimidation per Exhibit 4)
- Stigmatized work creating recruitment crisis
- Low employee morale → high turnover → more inexperienced workers → more accidents

**Strategic Misalignment**:
- Cost-cutting response (part-time labor) didn't address root causes
- Training focused on "appropriate work" but culture punished appropriate judgment
- No employee voice or problem-solving engagement
- Reactive management rather than preventive/systematic improvement

### Option 1: Quick Operational Fixes (Process Optimization)
**Pros**:
- Can show immediate results to JR East
- Leverage Yabe's operations expertise
- Address time/efficiency pain points
- Relatively low-cost interventions

**Cons**:
- Doesn't address cultural/morale root causes
- May increase pressure on already-stressed workers
- Risk of "squeezing more from less" without sustainability
- Won't solve recruitment/retention crisis

### Option 2: Culture Transformation First
**Pros**:
- Addresses root causes of turnover and morale
- Creates foundation for sustainable improvement
- Leverages Yabe's safety background (human factors focus per Exhibit 3)
- Could transform "3K" stigma into pride

**Cons**:
- Takes longer to show results
- Requires sustained commitment and investment
- Risk of JR East losing patience
- Cultural change is difficult and uncertain

### Option 3: Integrated Approach (Recommended)
**Pros**:
- Balances quick wins with long-term transformation
- Demonstrates progress while building foundation
- Engages employees in improvement (addresses morale + efficiency)
- Creates positive reinforcement cycle

**Cons**:
- More complex to execute
- Requires disciplined prioritization
- Demands both operational and leadership excellence

### Recommended Action

**Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Foundation + Quick Wins**

1. **Safety First** (Yabe's expertise area):
   - Conduct safety audit with employee input
   - Fix resource constraints (e.g., soap quotas)
   - Implement safety recognition program
   - Target: Reduce accidents by 50%

2. **Employee Engagement Launch**:
   - Form improvement teams from front-line workers
   - Ask: "What makes your job harder than it needs to be?"
   - Implement 3-5 employee-suggested improvements
   - Recognize top performers publicly

3. **Symbolic Cultural Changes**:
   - Allow/encourage employees to help customers
   - Change language from "cleaning staff" to "hospitality crew" or similar
   - Improve break room facilities (small investment, big signal)

**Phase 2 (Months 4-9): Process + People Development**

4. **Standardization & Simplification**:
   - Use improvement teams to optimize 7-minute process
   - Create visual management tools (train configuration guides)
   - Reduce complexity where possible (e.g., better positioning)

5. **Training & Career Development**:
   - Develop clear progression paths (part-time → full-time → supervisor)
   - Implement peer mentoring program
   - Cross-train to increase flexibility

6. **Measurement & Recognition**:
   - Track quality, safety, customer feedback by team
   - Celebrate improvements and lessons learned
   - Make progress visible to JR East and employees

**Phase 3 (Months 10-12): Sustainability & Scale**

7. **Cultural Embedding**:
   - Document new ways of working
   - Refresh recruiting to emphasize mission/pride
   - Build management capability in new culture

8. **JR East Relationship**:
   - Present results and business case for continued investment
   - Negotiate fair commission structure based on performance
   - Position Tessei as strategic partner, not just cost center

### Implementation Plan
