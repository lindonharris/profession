## Grade Placement

**Top Group - Excellent Performance** (Top 25% of section)
**Midterm Grade**: 1

## Specific Feedback

**Placement Rationale**:
- Particularly pleased with class preparation and participation
- Strong performance in both quantity and quality
- Taking into account spreadsheet uploads, polls, pre-class tutorials, and online exercise completion

**Professor's Note**:
- "At the risk of making you complacent, I will say that I am particularly pleased with your class preparation and participation, taking into account quantity and quality. Please keep it up!"

## Context

**Section Performance**:
- Distribution is exceedingly tight - difficult to divide section by participation
- Section as a group is well-prepared, asking good questions, helping each other with key concepts
- Comfortable and effective learning environment

**Grade Distribution**:
- Top 25%: Strong performance
- Middle 50%: Solid performance
- Bottom 25%: Performance that could improve

**Note**: This does not correspond to final grade distribution (I, II, III). Far more in third group than will receive III in course.

## Looking Ahead

- 8 classes covered so far - ample time for participation to move up or down
- Gap between categories is small
- This feedback is purely for personal benefit, not part of official record
