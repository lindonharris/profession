- **Interior Shot**: Doña Diega's home showing improved living conditions
- **Key Visual Message**: Tangible quality of life improvements from program

## Key Finance Concepts (from Tools Document)

### Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
- **Definition**: The discount rate that makes NPV of cash flows equal to zero
- **Formula**: 0 = CF₀ + CF₁/(1+IRR) + CF₂/(1+IRR)² + ...
- **Decision Rules**:
  - Accept projects with NPV > 0
  - Equivalently: Accept projects with IRR > discount rate
- **Purpose**: Puts future cash flows on apples-to-apples basis
  - Allows comparison of risky benefits/costs in future vs today
  - Discount rate = return on best alternative investment with equivalent risk

### Application to Patrimonio Hoy
This case specifically focuses on:
1. **Household borrowing ≠ lending rate** insight
2. IRR calculation for asymmetric cash flow timing
3. Appropriate discount rate selection given market conditions
4. Comparing alternative uses of capital (customer perspective and CEMEX perspective)

## Assignment Questions (Canvas)

### Primary Focus
**Important**: Class discussion focuses on **customer economics**, NOT CEMEX's perspective.

### Key Questions

1. **Customer IRR Analysis**:
   - Consider a low-income family planning to build and rent out a new 100-square-foot room
   - Would this family benefit from using Patrimonio Hoy vs building on their own?
   - Calculate the internal rate of return of using PH (versus going alone)

2. **Program Improvement**:
   - Should Francisco Garza recommend changes to make PH more attractive to low-income families?

### Analytical Guidelines
- **Time Aggregation**: Aggregate weekly cash flows into single flow at end of each 10-week cycle
- **Within Cycle**: Assume constant cash flows during a cycle
- **Between Cycles**: Assume inflation affects cash flows (where relevant) between cycles
- **Submission**: Enter IRR estimate by 8am on class day (in %, e.g., "9" = 9% IRR per cycle)

### Key Comparison Framework

**Traditional Self-Building Path**:
- Timeline: 208 weeks (20.8 cycles)
- Weekly spending: M$465
- Total cost: M$96,720
- Material waste: 30% higher usage
- Rental income: Starts after 208 weeks

**Patrimonio Hoy Path**:
- Timeline: 70 weeks (7 cycles)
- Weekly payment: M$120 (M$105 materials + M$15 fee)
- Total cost: M$8,400
- Material efficiency: 30% less waste
- Rental income: Starts after 70 weeks (138 weeks earlier!)

**Key Value Drivers**:
1. **Time savings**: 138 weeks earlier completion
2. **Cost savings**: Lower total outlay + less material waste
3. **Rental value**: M$50/week once completed
4. **Financing benefit**: Receive materials after 20% down (2 weeks), finance remaining 8 weeks per cycle

## My Analysis & Recommendations

*[To be filled with your black ink pre-class preparation notes]*

### IRR Calculation Framework

#### Setup: Comparing Two Alternatives
We need to calculate the IRR of **incremental cash flows** from choosing PH over traditional self-building.

#### Cash Flow Structure (Per 10-Week Cycle)

**PH Program Cash Flows**:
- Cycle 1-7: Pay M$1,200 per cycle (M$120/week × 10 weeks)
- After Cycle 7: Receive rental income M$500/cycle (M$50/week × 10 weeks)
- Room completed after 7 cycles = 70 weeks

**Traditional Self-Building Cash Flows**:
- Cycle 1-20.8: Pay M$4,650 per cycle (M$465/week × 10 weeks)
- After Cycle 20.8: Receive rental income M$500/cycle
- Room completed after 20.8 cycles = 208 weeks

**Incremental Cash Flows (PH minus Traditional)**:
- **Cycles 1-7**: Incremental outflow = M$1,200 - M$4,650 = **+M$3,450 savings per cycle**
- **Cycles 8-20.8**: Incremental inflow = M$500 - (-M$4,650) = **+M$5,150 per cycle**
  - (PH earns rental while Traditional still paying)
- **Cycle 21+**: Incremental inflow = M$500 - M$500 = **M$0**
  - (Both earn same rental income)

#### Key Insight
The IRR calculation asks: **What return do you earn on the M$3,450 savings each cycle (Cycles 1-7) when you invest it to get M$5,150 income in Cycles 8-20.8?**

This is essentially asking: What's the return on "investing" your savings into accelerated room completion?

#### Calculation Approach
Set NPV = 0 and solve for IRR:

```
0 = Σ(CF_t / (1+IRR)^t)

0 = 3,450/(1+IRR)^1 + 3,450/(1+IRR)^2 + ... + 3,450/(1+IRR)^7
    + 5,150/(1+IRR)^8 + 5,150/(1+IRR)^9 + ... + 5,150/(1+IRR)^20.8
```

#### Adjustments to Consider
1. **Inflation**: Does 7.1% construction inflation affect the comparison?
2. **Material Waste**: Traditional uses 30% more materials - is this reflected in M$465/week cost?
3. **Membership Fee**: M$15/week fee is pure cost to customer
4. **Financing Timing**: Materials received after week 2 of each cycle (early benefit)

#### Alternative Interpretation
If we focus on **build-to-rent** scenario:
- Traditional: Invest M$4,650/cycle for 20.8 cycles → Get M$500/cycle rental forever after
- PH: Invest M$1,200/cycle for 7 cycles → Get M$500/cycle rental forever after (13.8 cycles earlier)

**IRR measures**: The return on saving M$3,450/cycle by getting to rental income 13.8 cycles faster

### Initial Analysis Framework

*[Your pre-class work with black ink notes goes here]*

#### CEMEX Financial Analysis
**Key Question**: What is CEMEX's return on invested capital?

**Revenue Sources**:
- Membership fees: M$15/week × 70 weeks = M$1,050 per customer
- Cement sales: 34 kg/week × 70 weeks = 2,380 kg per customer
- Other building materials: M$105/week (minus cement)

**Cost Structure**:
- Cost of goods sold: Cement + other materials
- Financing cost: 8 weeks per cycle × 7 cycles = 56 weeks of financing
- Price lock risk: Absorbing 7.1% construction inflation
- Operating costs: Promotoras, offices, architects, delivery
- Default costs: 0.4% write-offs

**Capital Deployed**:
- Receivables: Average 8 weeks of materials per customer
- Working capital: Inventory for 42,500 customers
- Fixed investment: 48 offices, training, systems

### Option 1: Expand as Business Line
**Pros**:
- Enormous market: 16M self-built homes, 2.2M rooms/year
- Proven model: 75,000 families, <1% defaults
- Strategic access: Direct relationship with 40% of end customers
- Competitive moat: First-mover advantage, social capital barriers
- International potential: Similar markets in Egypt, Venezuela, Colombia, Philippines

**Cons**:
- Political risk: Backlash from profiting off poor
- Unclear returns: No explicit profitability data shown
- Capital intensive: Significant investment required for scale
- Operational complexity: Quality control, distributor management
- Reputational risk: Any failures magnified by social mission

### Option 2: Maintain as CSR Initiative
**Pros**:
- Brand value: Awards, recognition, goodwill
- Market intelligence: Customer insights for core business
- Risk mitigation: Lower expectations, less scrutiny
- Flexibility: Can continue without profit pressure

**Cons**:
- Missed opportunity: Large underserved market
- Unsustainable: CSR budgets vulnerable to cuts
- Limited scale: Won't reach full potential impact
- Cognitive dissonance: Treating customers as charity not clients
