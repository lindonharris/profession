# Progyny (Abridged)

## Quick Facts
- **Case #**: N9-225-112
- **Course**: [[FIN1]]
- **Class #**: 7 (Perpetuity Values)
- **Date Read**: 2025-10-06
- **Industry**: Healthcare - Fertility Benefits (B2B)
- **Geography**: United States

## Executive Summary
On March 14, 2024, portfolio manager Aida McCorvey must decide whether to maintain, reduce, or increase her position in Progyny (NASDAQ: PGNY) after its stock price fell 15% (from $41.38 to $35.40) following Alabama's ruling that frozen embryos are legally children. The case requires building a DCF valuation model from scratch using analyst projections to determine if the market overreacted to regulatory uncertainty.

## Case Context

### Company Background
- **Founded**: 2008 by Gina Bartasi (OPM 33, 2004) as Fertility Authority (info/social platform)
- **2015**: Merged with Auxogyn, rebranded as Progyny (fertility benefits provider)
- **2016**: Raised $14.7M Series B (Kleiner Perkins, TPG Biotech, SR One); Bartasi left
- **2017**: $10M Series B extension
- **Oct 2019**: IPO at $13/share, 10M shares offered (first fertility benefits company to go public)
- **Business Model**: B2B fertility benefits provider to self-insured employers
  - Employers pay per-employee subscription fee + treatment costs when used
  - Comprehensive "Smart Cycles" bundles (IVF, drugs, surrogacy, genetic screening)
  - Network of 950 specialists at 650 clinics across U.S.
  - Added Progyny Rx (pharmacy benefits) in 2018

### Industry Landscape
**IVF Market (2021 Data)**:
- 238,126 patients had 413,776 ART cycles at 453 U.S. clinics
- 91,906 live births, 97,128 live infants
- Only 2.3% of U.S. infants conceived using ART
- 167,689 cycles were egg/embryo banking (frozen for future)
- Cost: ~$23,000 per cycle, patients typically do 2-3 cycles (some up to 10)
- Only 16 of 50 states mandate infertility coverage
- Less than half of patients have fertility benefits
- 60% of large employers offer fertility benefits (much lower for small employers)
- Global ART market: $20B (2021) → projected $41.5B (2028)

**Competitive Landscape**:
- **2016 entrants**: Carrot Fertility, Stork Club (benefits + doctor connections)
- **2018 entrant**: Kindbody (benefits + own clinics, raised ~$30M)
- **Maven Clinic**: Comprehensive women's/family health platform (includes fertility)
  - Notable: Amazon uses Maven for employees in 50 countries (outside U.S./Canada)
- **2019 total VC**: $150M into fertility companies (at-home tests, sperm storage, egg-freezing)

### Timeline of Events
- **1973**: Roe v. Wade establishes constitutional right to abortion (trimester framework)
- **1978**: First successful IVF treatment
- **1992**: Planned Parenthood v. Casey replaces trimester framework with fetal viability
- **2017**: American Medical Association classifies infertility as a disease
- **2019**: 1 in 8 U.S. couples face fertility challenges
- **Dec 2021**: SCOTUS hears arguments in Dobbs v. Jackson
- **May 15, 2022**: Dobbs draft opinion leaked; analysts recommend avoiding Progyny stock
- **May 25, 2022**: Progyny CEO Peter Anevski reassures investors (<3% exposure to trigger-law states)
- **June 2022**: Dobbs ruling overturns Roe/Casey, allows states to regulate abortion
- **Feb 16, 2024**: Alabama Supreme Court rules frozen embryos are children (effectively bans IVF)
- **Feb 15, 2024**: Progyny stock at $41.38/share
- **March 14, 2024**: Stock drops to $35.40 (15% decline), McCorvey must decide
- **Early 2024**: Alabama enacts law providing civil/criminal immunity for IVF providers (critics say falls short of defining personhood)

## Key Protagonists
- **Aida McCorvey**: Portfolio Manager at Aldorin Capital Advisors (ACA) - fictional
  - Must decide: reduce, maintain, or increase Progyny position
  - Uses 10% discount rate, assumes 2% terminal growth rate

- **Peter Anevski**: CEO of Progyny (since Jan 2022)
  - Former COO, President, CFO
  - 14+ years at WebMD in senior finance roles

- **Gina Bartasi**: Founder (left 2016)
  - OPM 33, 2004
  - Now Founder & Executive Chairman of Kindbody (competitor)

## Central Problem/Decision

### The Question
Is Progyny a buy, hold, or sell at $35.40/share after the Alabama IVF ruling?

**Analysis required:**
1. Build DCF model to estimate enterprise value using Exhibit 4 analyst projections
2. Calculate implied share price
3. Assess impact of Alabama ruling (optimistic vs. pessimistic scenarios)
4. Account for potential investor political partisanship

### Constraints
1. Must build financial model from scratch (exhibits not templated)
2. Regulatory uncertainty (will other states follow Alabama?)
3. Political environment (2024 election year, Republican candidate views)
4. Analyst disagreement on impact (Truist/JPM bullish vs. bears citing spread risk)
5. Evidence of political partisanship affecting investor behavior (Exhibit 8)

### Success Metrics
- Enterprise value accuracy vs. market-implied $3.1B
- Share price estimate vs. $35.40 trading price
- Sensitivity analysis accounts for regulatory scenarios

## Analysis

### Strengths
- **Market Leader**: First fertility benefits company to go public (2019)
- **Strong Clinical Outcomes**: 62.8% pregnancy rate vs. 53.8% national average, 15.8% miscarriage vs. 18.4% national
- **Revenue Growth**: $1.1B (2023), up 38% YoY, first time over $1B
- **Profitability**: $62M net profit (2023), margins improving
- **Customer Base**: 5.3M lives covered, 58,013 ART cycles (2023)
- **Market Penetration**: 6-7% of large self-insured employer market, 17% of Fortune 500
- **Diversified Revenue**: 62% fertility benefits + 38% pharmacy (up from 17% in 2019)
- **Unit Economics**: $18,765 average revenue per ART cycle ($11,658 medical + $7,107 Rx)
- **Pharmacy Benefits Growth**: 10-20% cost savings, additional 10% from waste management
- **Network Effects**: 950 specialists at 650 clinics provide logistical help, emotional support
- **Verified Outcomes**: Only benefits provider reporting verified outcomes for every member

### Weaknesses
- **Regulatory Risk**: Alabama ruling creates uncertainty, potential for spread to other states
- **Geographic Concentration Risk**: Exposure to states with abortion restrictions
- **Competitive Threats**: Well-funded competitors (Kindbody $30M, Carrot $17M, Maven with Amazon)
- **Market Penetration**: Only 6-7% of target market (large self-insured employers)
- **Employer Dependency**: B2B model relies on employer benefit decisions
- **Out-of-Pocket Costs**: Most IVF patients lack coverage, high $23K/cycle cost barrier
- **Political Headwinds**: Republican presidential candidates calling embryos "babies"

### Opportunities
- **TAM Expansion**: Only 60% of large employers offer fertility benefits (lower for small)
- **Rx Growth**: Pharmacy benefits growing from 17% → 38% of revenue mix
- **Clinical Differentiation**: Superior outcomes create competitive moat
- **Employer Trend**: Growing recognition of infertility as important employee benefit
- **Demographic Tailwind**: Employees waiting longer to have children
- **M&A Potential**: Acquire competitors or be acquired by larger healthcare players

### Threats
- **Regulatory Cascade**: Florida, other states may follow Alabama ruling
- **TAM Reduction**: If 14.3% of states ban IVF (pessimistic scenario)
- **Political Climate**: 2024 election could embolden anti-IVF legislation
- **Embryo Storage Costs**: $400-$1,500/year adds burden if can't discard
- **Out-of-State Treatment**: Patients sending embryos elsewhere adds $10Ks to cost
- **Investor Partisanship**: Political views interfering with rational valuation (Exhibit 7/8)
- **Competitor Innovation**: Kindbody's integrated clinic model, Maven's comprehensive platform

## Discussion Questions

### Q1: Taking the assumptions in Exhibit 4 and the last paragraph of Page 5 as given, develop a discounted cash flow estimate for Progyny's enterprise value on March 14, 2024?

**Answer:** [To be calculated in class - build DCF model from scratch]

**DCF Model Components:**

**Step 1: Project Free Cash Flows (2024-2032)**
```
FCF = NOPAT + D&A - CapEx - Δ NWC

Where:
NOPAT = EBIT × (1 - Tax Rate)
Tax Rate = 21%
NWC = Accounts Receivable + Other Current Assets - Accounts Payable - Other Current Liabilities
```

**Key Metrics from Exhibit 4:**
- Revenue growth: $1,566.0M (2024E) → $4,071.2M (2032E)
- Gross Margin: 22.4% (2024E) → 25.3% (2032E)
- SG&A/Revenue: 15.2% (2024E) → 10.2% (2032E)
- Days Receivable: 88 days (constant)
- Other Current Assets/Revenue: 0.5%
- Accounts Payable/OpEx: 11.0%
- Other Current Liabilities/OpEx: 7.3%
- D&A and CapEx provided annually

**Step 2: Calculate Terminal Value (2033+)**
```
Terminal FCF = FCF(2032) × (1 + g)
Terminal Value = Terminal FCF / (WACC - g)

Where:
g = 2% (terminal growth rate)
WACC = 10% (discount rate)
```

**Step 3: Discount to Present Value**
```
PV(FCF) = Σ [FCF(t) / (1.10)^t] for t=2024 to 2032
PV(Terminal Value) = Terminal Value / (1.10)^9
Enterprise Value = PV(FCF) + PV(Terminal Value)
```

**Step 4: Calculate Equity Value**
```
Equity Value = Enterprise Value + Excess Cash - Debt
Share Price = Equity Value / Shares Outstanding

Given from case:
Excess Cash = $371.1M
Debt = $17.2M
Shares = 96.3M
```

---

### Q2: What does your discounted cash flow estimate from Question 1 imply about the value of one share of Progyny? Is it higher or lower than the trading price of $35.40?

**Answer:** [Depends on DCF calculation from Q1]

**Framework for Analysis:**

```
If DCF Share Price > $35.40: Stock is UNDERVALUED → BUY
If DCF Share Price = $35.40: Stock is FAIRLY VALUED → HOLD
If DCF Share Price < $35.40: Stock is OVERVALUED → SELL
```

**Market-Implied Enterprise Value Check:**
```
Market says EV = $3.1B
Your DCF says EV = $[X]B

Difference = $[X-3.1]B or [percentage]%
```

**Key Sensitivity Checks:**
- What discount rate makes DCF = $35.40? (solve for WACC)
- What terminal growth rate makes DCF = $35.40? (solve for g)
- What if gross margins don't expand as projected?
- What if SG&A doesn't improve to 10.2% of revenue?

---

### Q3: How would you modify these assumptions? What is the impact of the Alabama ruling on your forecast? Is Progyny a buy, a sell, or a hold?

**Answer:**

**Assumption Modifications:**

**1. Alabama Ruling Impact - Scenario Analysis:**

**Optimistic Case (-3% revenue):**
- Apply to all revenue line items 2024-2032
- Revised Revenue = Exhibit 4 Revenue × 0.97
- Assumes containment (only Alabama + existing trigger-ban states)
- JPM/Truist analyst view: <0.5% U.S. ART volumes affected

**Pessimistic Case (-3% to -14.3% revenue):**
- Year 1: -3%, linearly increasing to Year 9: -14.3%
- Reflects chain reaction risk (Florida, other Republican states)
- Political momentum in 2024 election year
- Embryo storage costs ($400-$1,500/year) reduce affordability

**2. Margin Assumptions:**
- **Bull Case**: Accept Exhibit 4 gross margin expansion (22.4% → 25.3%)
  - Rationale: Rx mix shift (higher margin), scale economies, pricing power
- **Bear Case**: Cap gross margin at 23% (conservative)
  - Rationale: Competitive pressure from Kindbody/Maven, regulatory costs

**3. SG&A Efficiency:**
- **Bull Case**: Accept SG&A improvement (15.2% → 10.2% of revenue)
  - Rationale: Scale economies, proven execution (already improved 18.1% → 16.0% from 2022-2023)
- **Bear Case**: Floor SG&A at 12% of revenue
  - Rationale: Regulatory compliance costs, competitive marketing spend

**4. Terminal Growth Rate:**
- **Bull Case**: 3% (demographic tailwinds, employer adoption)
- **Base Case**: 2% (case assumption)
- **Bear Case**: 1% (regulatory headwinds, market saturation)

**5. Discount Rate:**
- **Volatility Adjustment**: Increase WACC to 12% (reflects regulatory risk premium)
- **Political Risk**: Add 1-2% for political uncertainty (2024 election, SCOTUS composition)

**Final Recommendation Framework:**

**BUY if:**
- Base case DCF > $40/share (13% upside)
- Optimistic Alabama scenario DCF > $45/share (27% upside)
- Believe regulatory risk is contained (Alabama only)
- Believe market overreacted due to political partisanship (Exhibit 8 evidence)
- Thesis: 15% drop is excessive for <3% revenue exposure

**HOLD if:**
- Base case DCF = $33-37/share (±5% of current price)
- Alabama impact uncertain, wait for clarity
- Margins/SG&A projections aggressive but possible
- Thesis: Fairly valued, monitor regulatory developments

**SELL if:**
- Pessimistic Alabama scenario DCF < $30/share (15% downside)
- Believe Florida + other states will follow (chain reaction)
- Gross margin expansion unlikely (competitive pressure)
- SG&A efficiency gains overestimated
- Thesis: Further downside as regulatory risk crystallizes

**My Recommended Position: [HOLD with bias to BUY]**

**Rationale:**
1. **Alabama Impact Overstated**: <0.5% of U.S. ART volumes, early 2024 law provides immunity
2. **Political Partisanship Evidence**: Exhibit 8 shows Republican-state fund managers sold more than Democrat-state managers → suggests emotion over fundamentals
3. **Strong Fundamentals**: 47.5% revenue CAGR (2019-2023), improving margins, market leader
4. **Option Value**: Alabama law could be overturned, Florida may not follow, federal protections possible
5. **Risk/Reward**: If Alabama contained, stock should recover to $40+; if spreads, downside to $30

**Catalysts to Monitor:**
- Florida legislative action on embryo personhood
- 2024 election results (presidential + state legislatures)
- Other states' responses to Alabama ruling
- Federal legislative proposals to protect IVF access
- Q2 2024 earnings (does utilization decline in Alabama?)

## My Analysis & Recommendations

### DCF Model Summary

**Model File**: [[N9-225-112-dcf-model.pdf]]

**Key Assumptions:**
- Discount Rate (WACC): 10%
- Terminal Growth Rate: 2%
- Tax Rate: 21%
- Revenue Scenario: One-Time Reduction (Optimistic -3% Alabama impact)

**Model Results:**
```
Market-Implied EV: $3,055.22M
Calculated EV: $[TBD]M
Stock Price (Market): $35.40
Stock Price (Calculated): $[TBD]

Delta: $[TBD] or [X]% difference
```

**Key Formulae:**
```
Free Cash Flow = NOPAT + D&A - CapEx - Δ NWC
NOPAT = EBIT × (1 - 0.21)
NWC = AR + Other CA - AP - Other CL
Terminal Value = FCF(2032) × 1.02 / (0.10 - 0.02)
Enterprise Value = PV(FCF 2024-2032) + PV(Terminal Value)
Equity Value = EV + $371.1M - $17.2M
Share Price = Equity Value / 96.3M
```

**Sensitivity Analysis:**
- Impact of changing discount rate (9%, 10%, 11%, 12%)
- Impact of changing terminal growth (1%, 2%, 3%)
- Impact of revenue scenarios (Base, Optimistic -3%, Pessimistic -3% to -14.3%)

## Personal Reflections & Key Takeaways

### Synthesis of Learning
1. **[Perpetuity mechanics in DCF]**: Terminal value typically represents 50-80% of enterprise value, making the perpetuity growth rate assumption (g) critical. Even 1% change in g can swing valuation by 20-30%.

2. **[Regulatory risk valuation]**: Market's 15% drop may reflect rational response to binary outcomes (Alabama contained vs. spreads) rather than pure overreaction. Option pricing frameworks may better capture this than DCF.

3. **[Political partisanship in finance]**: Exhibit 7/8 provide empirical evidence that investor politics influence valuations. This creates arbitrage opportunities for dispassionate investors willing to buy when others sell for non-fundamental reasons.

### Applications to Future Situations
- Always sensitivity-test terminal value assumptions (g and WACC)
- Scenario analysis essential for binary regulatory/legal risks
- Political events create mispricings when investors trade on emotion vs. fundamentals

### Questions for Further Research
- What happened to Progyny stock after March 2024? Did Alabama fears materialize?
- How do you value binary regulatory outcomes using real options vs. DCF?
- What's the empirical relationship between political partisanship and investment returns?
