- **Date Read**: 2025-09-22 (Day 1), 2025-09-23 (Day 2)
- **Industry**: Retail/Distribution (Lumber)
- **Geography**: Pacific Northwest, USA

## Executive Summary
> Butler Lumber Company, a profitable retail lumber distributor, faces a cash shortage despite strong growth and profitability. Mark Butler must decide whether to switch from Suburban National Bank's $250,000 secured loan limit to Northrop National Bank's $465,000 unsecured line of credit to fund anticipated growth to $3.6M in sales.

## Case Context

- Located in growing suburb with railroad siding access
- No sales reps - telephone orders only
- 11 total employees (including Butler)

### Industry Landscape
- Competitive market with price competition
- Seasonal business (55% of sales April-September)
- Mix of new construction and repair work
- Trade terms: 2/10 net 30
- Quantity discounts available from suppliers

### Timeline of Events

## Central Problem/Decision

### The Question

2. Heavy reliance on trade credit (not taking 2% discounts)
3. Need to fund projected growth to $3.6M (1991) and 25% annually thereafter
4. Northrop loan covenants: restrictions on borrowing, working capital maintenance, fixed asset investments, owner withdrawals

### Success Metrics

## Discussion Questions

### Day 1 Questions
1. Why is Butler Lumber short of cash despite being profitable?
2. What are the sources and uses of Butler's cash during 1988-1990?
3. What is Butler's cash conversion cycle?
4. How has Butler been financing his growth?

### Day 2 Questions
1. Do you agree with Mr. Butler's estimate that he will need up to $465,000 in 1991?
2. How much will he need to borrow from Northrop to finance expansion through end of 1991?
3. How much will Butler need over the next few years if sales grow at 25% per year?
4. What changes to his business model would you recommend?
5. Should Butler accept the Northrop National Bank offer?

## My Analysis & Recommendations

### Day 1: Understanding the Cash Problem

### Cash Flow Analysis
The fundamental issue is that Butler's growth is consuming more cash than operations generate:
- Working capital increases with sales growth
- Unable to take 2% discounts = effective 36.7% annual interest rate
- Funding growth through expensive trade credit

### Financing Needs Projection (1991)
Assuming $3.6M sales in 1991:
- Projected receivables: ~$430K (43 days)
- Projected inventory: ~$560K (78 days)
- Less: Accounts payable ~$344K (48 days)
- Net working capital need: ~$646K
- Plus: Debt repayment ($290K to replace existing debt)
- Plus: Fixed assets and other needs
- Total financing need likely exceeds $465K line

**Key Assumptions for Pro Forma:**
- Tax rate: 25% (given in case)
- Interest rate: 10.5% on beginning-of-year balance
- Debt structure: Line of credit (current liability)
- Replace existing bank loan ($233K) and long-term debt ($57K)

### Option 1: Accept Northrop's $465,000 Line
**Pros**:
- Larger credit facility
- Unsecured (no real property lien)
- Can take purchase discounts
- Better banking relationship

**Cons**:
- May still be insufficient for growth
- Restrictive covenants
- Higher rate (10.5% vs current)
- Must sever Suburban relationship

### Option 2: Stay with Suburban National
**Pros**:
- Existing relationship
- Known terms

**Cons**:
- Inadequate $250,000 limit
- Must secure with real property
- Continued reliance on expensive trade credit
- Constrains growth potential

### Day 2: Pro Forma Analysis & Recommendations

#### Pro Forma Assumptions
- Sales 1991: $3.6 million
- Tax rate: 25%
- Interest rate: 10.5% on new line of credit
- Debt to replace: $290,000 ($233K bank + $57K long-term)
- Growth rate post-1991: 25% annually

### Recommended Action
> Accept Northrop National Bank's offer but negotiate for higher limit or growth provisions

### Implementation Plan
1. Prepare detailed cash flow projections showing need beyond $465K
2. Negotiate covenant flexibility for working capital fluctuations
3. Establish inventory management system to optimize cash
4. Implement aggressive collection procedures
5. Consider slowing growth rate to sustainable level
6. Explore additional financing (asset-based lending, factoring)

## Personal Reflections & Key Takeaways

### Synthesis of Learning
1. **Profitable ≠ Cash Rich**: Growing companies can be profitable yet cash-poor due to working capital investments. The faster the growth, the greater the cash consumption.

2. **Cost of Trade Credit**: Not taking 2/10 net 30 discounts equals ~37% annual interest - far more expensive than bank debt. This hidden cost erodes profitability.

3. **Working Capital Management**: The cash conversion cycle (receivables + inventory - payables) determines cash needs. Butler's 73-day cycle means cash is tied up for over 2 months.

4. **Growth vs. Financial Capacity**: Sustainable growth rate = ROE × (1 - payout ratio). Growing faster requires external financing or accepting financial stress.

### Applications to Future Situations
- Always model cash flows separately from P&L projections
- Consider working capital needs when evaluating growth strategies
- Establish credit facilities before needing them
- Balance growth ambitions with financial capacity

### Questions for Further Research
- What are typical working capital ratios for lumber distributors?
- How do companies optimize cash conversion cycles?
- What are alternatives to traditional bank financing for growing companies?
- How do you value the cost of restrictive covenants?
