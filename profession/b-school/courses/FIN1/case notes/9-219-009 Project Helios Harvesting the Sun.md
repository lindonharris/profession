# Project Helios: Harvesting the Sun

## Quick Facts
- **Case #**: 9-219-009
- **Course**: [[FIN1]]
- **Class #**: 4
- **Date Read**: 2025-10-05
- **Industry**: Renewable Energy / Residential Solar
- **Geography**: Massachusetts / Boston

## Executive Summary
In late 2017, Ashley Telkes, a marine biologist living near Boston, Massachusetts, must decide whether to invest in solar panels for her home. While predisposed to environmentally friendly alternatives, Telkes cannot afford a poor financial decision and must withdraw from long-term savings to finance the significant up-front costs. With state subsidies for solar power projects set to be reduced soon and a looming deadline to qualify for current incentives, Telkes needs to determine if this major solar power project makes financial sense using NPV analysis.

## Case Context

### Company Background

**Ashley Telkes:**
- Marine biologist living near Boston, Massachusetts
- Environmentally conscious homeowner
- Previous eco-friendly measures taken:
  - Re-insulated roof and walls
  - Opted for ceiling fans instead of air conditioning
  - Replaced incandescent lights with LED bulbs
- Financial constraint: Must withdraw from long-term savings to finance solar project
- Time constraint: Deadline looming to qualify for current state subsidies

### Industry Landscape

**Solar Power Generation History:**
- **1839**: Alexandre Edmond Becquerel (age 19) discovers photovoltaic effect
- **1954**: Bell Labs scientists (Chapin, Fuller, Pearson) demonstrate first practical "solar battery"
  - Initial efficiency: 6% (could convert only 6% of sun's energy to electricity)
  - "Ideal" solar cell theoretical efficiency: 23%
  - By 2009: Solar cells achieved >40% efficiency with improved designs and materials

**Current Market Context (2017):**
- State subsidies available for residential solar projects
- Subsidies expected to be reduced in near future
- Federal and state tax credits available
- SREC (Solar Renewable Energy Certificate) market in Massachusetts

### Timeline of Events
- **1839**: Photovoltaic effect discovered
- **1954**: First practical solar cell demonstrated
- **2009**: Solar cells achieve >40% efficiency
- **Pre-2017**: Telkes implements passive eco-friendly home improvements
- **Late 2017**: Decision point - deadline approaching for current state subsidies
- **End of 2017**: Initial expenditure timing (per assignment assumptions)
- **2018**: Tax credits realized
- **2018-2047**: 30-year operational period for solar system

## Key Protagonists
- **Ashley Telkes**: Marine biologist and homeowner
  - Background: Environmentally conscious, financially prudent
  - Key decisions: Whether to invest in residential solar power system
  - Constraints: Limited savings, looming subsidy deadline

## Central Problem/Decision

### The Question
Should Ashley Telkes invest in a residential solar power system, and does the net present value of the project justify withdrawing funds from long-term savings?

### Assignment Questions:

**Question 1**: What are the pros and cons of the potential solar power project that Telkes is considering?

**Question 2**: Construct an annual model of the project's incremental cash costs and benefits. **Key Assumptions**:
- Telkes does NOT remove trees shading her house
- Initial expenditure: End of 2017
- Subsequent costs/benefits: End of each year 2018-2047
- Useful life: 30 years
- Power generation degrades: 0.5% per year
- Inverter replacement: Year 15 at $1,663 cost
- SRECs sold in year earned at guaranteed prices (Exhibit 5), fractional SRECs allowed
- Annual electricity consumption: Constant (equal to 2017 consumption in kW)
- Massachusetts electricity rates: Increase 3.0% per year
- Discount rate: 5.0%
- Full retail net metering
- Tax effects: Include ONLY federal solar tax credit + state residential energy tax credit (2018), ignore depreciation

**Question 3**: What is the net present value of the solar power project?

**Question 4**: Would you advise that Telkes keep or remove the trees?

**Question 5**: What should Telkes do?
- What are the most important assumptions affecting your recommendation?
- What aspects give you the most comfort or trouble you the most?
- Should governments offer incentives to encourage projects like this?

### Constraints
- Significant up-front capital requirement (must withdraw from long-term savings)
- Looming deadline for current state subsidies
- Trees shading house (affects power generation)
- 30-year investment horizon
- Cannot afford poor financial decision

### Success Metrics
- Net present value (NPV) of project
- Payback period
- Internal rate of return (IRR)
- Sensitivity to key assumptions (electricity rate growth, discount rate, subsidy levels)

## Analysis

### SWOT Analysis

**Strengths:**
- State subsidies available (for now)
- Federal and state tax credits
- SREC revenue stream (guaranteed prices)
- Electricity rate increases (3% annually) benefit solar economics
- 30-year useful life of system
- Environmental benefits align with personal values

**Weaknesses:**
- High up-front capital cost (withdrawal from savings)
- Trees reduce power generation efficiency
- System degradation (0.5% annually)
- Inverter replacement cost at Year 15 ($1,663)
- 30-year commitment with illiquid asset

**Opportunities:**
- Lock in current higher state subsidies before reduction
- Federal and state tax credits provide immediate value (2018)
- Electricity rate increases make future savings more valuable
- SREC market provides additional revenue stream
- Potential for electricity rate increases >3% (upside scenario)

**Threats:**
- Subsidy reduction if delayed past deadline
- Electricity rate increases could be <3% (downside scenario)
- SREC prices could change (though guaranteed in Exhibit 5)
- System maintenance costs not fully captured
- Discount rate assumption (5%) may be too low/high
- Opportunity cost of alternative investments with withdrawn savings

## Financial Analysis
[To be filled using Project Helios Template Excel file]

### Key Components to Model:
1. **Initial Investment** (End of 2017):
   - Solar panel system cost
   - Installation costs
   - Less: Federal solar tax credit (realized 2018)
   - Less: State residential energy tax credit (realized 2018)

2. **Annual Benefits** (2018-2047):
   - Electricity cost savings (2017 consumption × escalating rates)
   - SREC revenue (from Exhibit 5 guaranteed prices)
   - Both adjusted for 0.5% annual degradation in power generation

3. **Annual Costs** (2018-2047):
   - Maintenance costs (if any)
   - Inverter replacement (Year 15: $1,663)

4. **NPV Calculation**:
   - Discount all cash flows at 5.0%
   - Sum of PV of all inflows and outflows

### Sensitivity Analysis:
- Impact of tree removal (increased power generation)
- Electricity rate growth (2%, 3%, 4% scenarios)
- Discount rate (4%, 5%, 6% scenarios)
- System degradation rate variations

## Key Exhibits
- **Exhibit 5**: SREC guaranteed prices (by year)
- Project Helios Template (Excel) - Required for analysis submission
- Project Helios Tools (Excel) - Supporting tools
