# Selling for a Song: Valuing Robert Farrell's Music Catalog (Abridged)

## Quick Facts
- **Case #**: N2-224-114
- **Course**: [[FIN1]]
- **Date Read**: 2025-10-13
- **Industry**: Music & Entertainment
- **Geography**: United States - Los Angeles, CA

## Executive Summary
> Robert Farrell (professionally known as Reeves), an accomplished EDM and hip-hop producer-songwriter, receives offers to sell his music catalog but is disappointed by the maximum bid of $22 million (10.5x his 2021 royalties of $2.1M). His mentor Colin Wright recently sold a comparable catalog for $46 million (18x his 2021 royalties of $2.6M). Farrell must determine whether the valuation difference is justified or if he's receiving a low-ball offer, using multiples valuation and DCF analysis to inform his decision before time-sensitive offers expire.

## Case Context

### Company Background
- **Robert Farrell (Reeves)**: Accomplished electronic dance music and hip-hop producer-songwriter
- Previous album reached top 10 on Billboard 200
- Concerts consistently sell out venues with 10,000+ capacity
- Preparing new album release post-COVID pandemic
- Planning largest tour yet, kicking off at Coachella

### Industry Landscape
**Historical Evolution**:
- Mid-15th century: Printing press enables mass production of sheet music
- Late 19th century: Cylinder phonograph invented
- Early 20th century: Radio broadcasting emerges
- 1999: U.S. recorded music revenue peaks at $14.6B (88% from CDs)
- 2001: Napster reaches 24M+ registered users, 80M downloads

- 2002-2014: Industry revenue declines from $14.6B to $6.7B
- 2003: iTunes Store launches (digital downloads)
- Mid-2000s: Spotify and Pandora emerge (streaming)
- 2021: U.S. recorded music revenue hits new peak of $15.0B (85% from streaming)

**Key Industry Transformation**:
- Streaming has transformed music consumption from discretionary purchase to utility purchase
- Subscription-based models create regular, predictable cash flows
- Music royalties emerge as investable alternative asset class
- 2021: $5.2B+ in catalog transactions announced, $6.7B raised for future acquisitions

### Timeline of Events
- **Early 2022**: Farrell working in LA recording studio, producing first post-COVID album
- **Recent**: Mentor Colin Wright sells catalog for $46M (18x 2021 royalties of $2.6M)
- **Current**: Farrell solicits offers, receives maximum bid of $22M (10.5x 2021 royalties of $2.1M)
- **Decision Point**: Time-sensitive offers expiring in weeks

## Key Protagonists
- **Robert Farrell (Reeves)**: Electronic dance music and hip-hop producer-songwriter
  - Background: Top 10 Billboard album, sold-out concerts, established career
  - Current challenge: Determining if catalog valuation is fair
  - Key concern: Appears to be receiving lower multiple than comparable artist (Wright)
  - Time pressure: Best offers expire in weeks

- **Colin Wright**: Farrell's mentor and occasional co-producer
  - Background: More established among "music elite"
  - Recent transaction: Sold catalog for $46M (18x multiple)
  - Catalog characteristics: 105 songs, $2.6M in 2021 royalties, older catalog

- **Dustin Code**: Farrell's manager
  - Role: Summarizes key aspects of both catalogs for comparison
  - Provides data for valuation analysis

## Central Problem/Decision

### The Question
> Should Robert Farrell accept the current high bid of $22 million for his music catalog, or is this a low-ball offer that warrants holding out for a higher valuation closer to Wright's 18x multiple?

### Constraints
1. **Time Sensitivity**: Best offers expire in weeks
2. **Information Asymmetry**: Farrell is musician, not financial valuation expert
3. **Comparable Transaction**: Wright's 18x multiple creates anchoring effect
4. **Career Stage**: Farrell less established in "music elite" than Wright
5. **Catalog Characteristics**: Younger catalog may have different risk profile
6. **Future Income Risk**: Relies on touring income; catalog sale provides liquidity/diversification

### Success Metrics
- Maximize value of catalog sale
- Ensure valuation reflects true economic value of royalty stream
- Make informed decision based on rigorous financial analysis
- Balance immediate liquidity needs against potential future value

## Analysis

### Music Royalty Economics

#### Two Copyright Types
1. **Compositional Copyright (Publishing Rights)**:
   - Covers underlying melody, arrangement of notes and chords
   - Owned by songwriter and publisher (typically 50/50 split negotiable)
   - U.S. protection: Life of last surviving co-composer + 70 years

2. **Master Copyright**:
   - Covers actual sound recording by specific artist
   - Typically owned by record label (funds production, marketing, distribution)
   - Royalties negotiated between label and recording artist

#### Royalty Allocation (Per $100 Gross Streaming Revenue)
- **Streaming Service**: $30.00 (30%)
- **Compositional Copyright**: $15.00 (15%) → Split between songwriter and publisher
- **Master Copyright**: $55.00 (55%) → Split between record label and recording artist

**Example** (if artist wrote and recorded song):
- Songwriter share (75% of 15%): $11.25
- Recording artist share (20% of 55%): $11.00
- **Total to artist**: $22.25 per $100 gross revenue

### Catalog Comparison: Farrell vs. Wright

| Metric | Farrell Catalog | Wright Catalog |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| Number of Songs | 90 | 105 |
| 2021 Total Royalties | $2.1M | $2.6M |
| Average Royalty per Song | $23,333 | $24,381 |
| Catalog Age Profile | Younger songs | Older songs |
| Sale Price Received/Offered | $22M (offer) | $46M (sold) |
| Multiple of 2021 Royalties | 10.5x | 18x |

### Key Valuation Factors

1. **Song Age and Royalty Decay**:
   - New songs experience significant royalty decreases in years immediately following release
   - Decay rate diminishes over time
   - Older songs reach "steady-state" with more stable, predictable royalties
   - Music royalty funds prefer older catalogs for stability

2. **Royalty Growth Assumptions**:
   - Industry-wide growth rates applied
   - Combined with decay rates by song age
   - Example: 2-year-old song with 30% decay + 6% industry growth = 25.8% net decline
     - Calculation: (1 - 30%) × (1 + 6%) - 1 = -25.8%

3. **Tax Treatment**:
   - Purchase price amortized evenly over 5 years
   - Non-cash expense reduces taxable income (like depreciation)
   - Wright catalog ($46M): $9.2M/year amortization deduction for 5 years
   - Corporate tax rate: 20%
   - Buyers can take full, immediate advantage of amortization tax shields

4. **Discount Rate**:
   - Manager recommends 8.5% (consistent with Massarsky Consulting industry standard)
   - Represents midpoint between different investor hurdle rates (4% pension funds to 14% PE)
   - Reflects risk-adjusted return requirement for music royalty asset class

### Investment Thesis for Music Catalogs

**Why Financial Buyers Are Buying**:
1. **Predictable Cash Flows**: Streaming subscriptions create steady, regular income
2. **Low Economic Correlation**: Music consumption resistant to economic downturns
3. **Copyright Protection**: Legal monopoly on royalty streams for life + 70 years
4. **Alternative Asset Class**: Diversification benefits, low correlation to equity markets
5. **Higher Yields**: Attractive returns in post-2008 low-yield environment
6. **Utility Purchase Model**: "All you can eat" streaming unlikely to be cut in recessions

**Why Artists Are Selling**:
1. **Liquidity Event**: Convert "river of nickels" into lump sum
2. **Touring Risk**: Live performance income uncertain (COVID highlighted this)
3. **Genre/Popularity Risk**: Musical tastes change, falling out of favor possible
4. **Age/Retirement**: No traditional retirement savings for many artists
5. **Estate Planning**: Simplify inheritance, avoid family disputes
6. **Financial Needs**: Current expenses may exceed current royalty income

## Discussion Questions & Detailed Answers

### 1. Why are financial buyers buying song catalogs? Why have artists been selling their song catalogs?

**Answer: A perfect alignment of buyer demand for alternative assets and artist need for liquidity/risk mitigation - enabled by streaming's transformation of music into predictable cash flows.**

**Financial Buyers' Perspective - Why Buy?**

**1. Streaming Revolutionized Economics**:
- **Before (1999-2014)**: Music was discretionary purchase (CD,Download → Physical/digital unit sales dropped 54% from $14.6B to $6.7B)
- **After (2015-2021)**: Music became utility purchase (subscription-based streaming)
- Result: Predictable, recurring revenue streams like SaaS companies
- 2021: Streaming = 85% of $15.0B recorded music revenue

**2. Attractive Risk-Return Profile**:
- **Yield**: Higher than traditional fixed income in post-2008 low-yield environment
- **Duration**: Copyright protection for life + 70 years = very long-duration asset
- **Correlation**: Music consumption uncorrelated with economic cycles (listen during good & bad times)
- **Downside Protection**: "Utility" streaming subscriptions rarely cancelled in recessions
- **Upside**: Some catalog appreciation possible (nostalgia, sync licensing, sampling)

**3. Tax Efficiency**:
- Purchase price amortized evenly over 5 years (like depreciation)
- Non-cash expense reduces taxable income
- **Example**: $46M Wright catalog = $9.2M/year tax deduction × 5 years
- At 20% corporate tax rate: $1.84M/year in tax savings = $7.3M NPV benefit (@8.5% discount)
- **After-tax IRR significantly higher than pre-tax IRR**

**4. Alternative Asset Class Diversification**:
- Institutional investors (pension funds, endowments) seek alternatives to stocks/bonds
- Low correlation with equity markets, real estate, commodities
- **Portfolio theory**: Adding uncorrelated assets improves risk-adjusted returns
- Music royalties offer diversification without exotic risks (like crypto, hedge funds)

**5. Professionalization of Asset Class**:
- Specialist funds emerged: Hipgnosis Songs Fund, Primary Wave, Iconic Artists Group
- Developed valuation methodologies, industry expertise, catalog management capabilities
- Created secondary market for investors → increased liquidity
- 2021: $5.2B in transactions, $6.7B raised for future acquisitions

**Artists' Perspective - Why Sell?**

**1. Liquidity Event & Financial Security**:
- Most artists lack traditional retirement savings (401k, pension)
- Royalties are "river of nickels" - unpredictable monthly/quarterly payments
- Lump sum enables: Home purchase, debt paydown, retirement planning, estate liquidity
- **Case example**: David Crosby (age 79) said "I need the money"

**2. Career Stage & Touring Risk**:
- Older artists: Touring becomes physically difficult, income uncertain
- COVID-19 exposed dependence on live performance income
- Catalog sale diversifies revenue sources → reduces career risk
- **Farrell's situation**: Planning largest tour yet - what if he gets injured? illness? pandemic 2.0?

**3. Genre/Popularity Risk Mitigation**:
- Musical tastes change over time (disco → grunge → EDM → hip-hop evolution)
- Today's hit genre may fall out of favor
- **Farrell specific concern**: EDM and hip-hop are current trends - will they have staying power like rock/soul?
- Selling now locks in value while genre is hot

**4. Estate Planning & Family Complexity**:
- Royalty rights create ongoing management burden for heirs
- Family disputes over song usage, licensing, brand management common
- Lump sum simplifies inheritance, avoids conflict
- **Case analogy**: Michael Jackson estate litigation, Prince estate complications

**5. Time Value of Money**:
- Artists can use proceeds to invest in higher-growth opportunities
- Reinvest in new music production, business ventures, real estate
- Compounding returns may exceed royalty stream growth
- Especially relevant for younger artists like Farrell with long runway

**6. Tax Planning**:
- Capital gains treatment (often more favorable than ordinary income from royalties)
- Timing sale in low-income year can minimize tax burden
- Estate tax reduction by converting income-producing asset to liquid cash

**The Perfect Storm (2018-2022)**:
1. **Supply**: Artists with liquidity needs post-COVID
2. **Demand**: Institutional investors seeking yield + diversification
3. **Enabling Tech**: Streaming provides predictable cash flows (unlike pre-2015 era)
4. **Market Structure**: Specialized funds with expertise + capital
5. **Interest Rates**: Near-zero rates make future cash flows more valuable (lower discount rates)

**The Result**: Explosion in transactions (Bruce Springsteen $500M, Bob Dylan $400M+, Neil Young $150M, etc.)

### 2. Would you bid $46 million for Wright's royalty stream? Would you pay as high a multiple of current royalties for Farrell's royalty stream? Why or why not?

### Question 2: Valuation Analysis Framework

**Key Factors Justifying Valuation Differential**:

1. **Catalog Age Composition**:
   - Wright's catalog has older songs → lower decay rates → more stable cash flows
   - Farrell's catalog has younger songs → higher decay rates → more volatile cash flows
   - Older catalogs command premium multiples due to predictability

2. **Risk-Adjusted Cash Flows**:
   - Need to build DCF model projecting royalties for each song by age
   - Apply age-specific decay rates and industry growth assumptions
   - Discount at 8.5% to present value
   - Compare PV to asking price to determine if multiple is justified

3. **Tax Shield Value**:
   - Amortization deductions worth more to high-tax-rate buyers
   - 5-year amortization at 20% tax rate adds material value
   - Need to incorporate into DCF analysis

**Analysis Approach**:
- Project cash flows for both catalogs using Exhibit 4 (song-by-song breakdown)
- Apply Exhibit 5 decay rates by song age + industry growth assumptions
- Calculate after-tax cash flows incorporating amortization tax shields
- Discount to present value at 8.5%
- Compare calculated values to transaction prices to assess reasonableness

### Question 3: Recommendation to Farrell

**Preliminary Assessment** (pending detailed DCF analysis):

**Option 1: Accept Current High Bid ($22M, 10.5x)**
**Pros**:
- Immediate liquidity and certainty
- Eliminates royalty stream risk (genre trends, popularity)
- Diversifies away from music industry concentration
- Can reinvest in other assets or career development

**Cons**:
- May be leaving money on table if valuation is too low
- Gives up upside from potential catalog appreciation
- Emotional cost of relinquishing life's work

**Option 2: Hold Out for Higher Multiple (Closer to 18x)**
**Pros**:
- Potential to capture full economic value if comparable to Wright
- Time-value of waiting may be small relative to potential value gain

**Cons**:
- Offers may expire; alternative buyers may not materialize
- Market conditions could deteriorate
- Personal financial needs may be urgent (no other retirement savings)
- Catalog differences may genuinely justify lower multiple

**Recommended Action**:
> **Complete rigorous DCF analysis first, then negotiate strategically**

1. **Immediate (This Week)**:
   - Build detailed DCF model using Exhibit 4 and 5 data
   - Calculate fair value range for Farrell catalog
   - Determine if $22M (10.5x) is within reasonable valuation range

2. **If DCF suggests higher value**:
   - Request deadline extensions from bidders citing additional analysis
   - Share key valuation insights (without full model) to justify higher price
   - Counter at appropriate multiple based on DCF output
   - Negotiate with multiple bidders to create competitive tension

3. **If DCF confirms $22M range is fair**:
   - Accept current high bid before offers expire
   - Recognize that younger catalog genuinely warrants lower multiple
   - Focus on redeploying capital wisely

4. **Risk Mitigation**:
   - Consider partial catalog sale (e.g., older songs only) to test market
   - Structure earnout based on future performance
   - Negotiate retained creative control/approval rights

### Key Insights

**Catalogs Are Not Homogeneous**: Age composition dramatically affects risk profile and appropriate multiple. Wright's older catalog justifies premium valuation through lower volatility and higher predictability.

**Multiples Can Be Misleading**: Raw multiple comparison ignores underlying cash flow characteristics. Must analyze present value of projected cash flows to determine fair value.

**Tax Shields Matter**: Amortization deductions create value for buyers, which should be reflected in purchase price. Sophisticated buyers will factor this into bids.

**Artist Motivations Vary**: Farrell is younger, still touring, less immediate liquidity need than artists like David Crosby. Has more flexibility to wait for right price.

### Synthesis of Learning

1. **Multiples Valuation Requires Comparable Comparables**: Simply comparing multiples across transactions without adjusting for underlying asset characteristics (age, risk, growth) leads to flawed conclusions. Must normalize for differences.

2. **DCF Anchors Valuation Analysis**: Multiples are useful for market checks, but intrinsic value comes from discounted cash flow analysis. Build the model to understand what drives value.

3. **Tax Treatment Affects Asset Values**: Non-cash expenses (amortization, depreciation) that shield taxable income create real economic value for buyers. This value should be reflected in purchase price negotiations.

4. **Alternative Asset Classes Require New Frameworks**: Music catalogs as investable assets represent convergence of entertainment industry and finance. Traditional valuation approaches must be adapted for unique characteristics (copyright protection, royalty decay, streaming dynamics).

### Applications to Future Situations
- Any asset valuation involving cash flow projections with non-constant growth
- Comparable company analysis requiring adjustment for differences
- Tax shield valuation in M&A transactions
- Asset class innovation and emergence of new investment opportunities

### Questions for Further Research
- How sensitive is catalog valuation to discount rate assumptions? (8.5% vs 7% vs 10%)
- What is optimal portfolio strategy for music royalty fund? (diversification across genres, eras, artists)
- How do major catalog transactions affect pricing for smaller artists?
- What contract terms do artists typically negotiate beyond purchase price? (creative control, usage restrictions)
