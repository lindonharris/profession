# The Mighty Squirrel Brewery and Taproom

## Quick Facts
- **Case #**: 9-223-003
- **Course**: [[FIN1]]
- **Class #**: 3
- **Date Read**: 2025-10-05
- **Industry**: Craft Beer / Food & Beverage
- **Geography**: Massachusetts / Boston area

## Executive Summary
In late fall 2017, Mighty Squirrel founders Henry Manice and Naveen Pawar face a critical funding decision for their strategic pivot from national brand with contract manufacturing to local Massachusetts brewery with taproom. After raising $2.4M (Series A) in 2014 for national expansion and $2.3M (Series A-1) in 2016 to pivot strategy, they've negotiated a 15-year lease in Waltham requiring $3.7M in capital expenditures, $350K security deposit, and $400K annual rent. With $2.1M cash on hand (Dec 2016) and monthly losses of $80K, they must determine: (1) How much additional funding needed to complete Waltham brewery/taproom? (2) Can they afford to proceed with available MassDevelopment Bank loan ($900K at 5%) and potential Series A-2 equity round ($2M)? The strategic question: Does the pivot from contract manufacturing to owned brewery make financial sense?

## Case Context

### Company Background

**Mighty Squirrel Brewing Company:**
- **Founded**: 2010 (concept developed in San Diego)
- **Founders**: Henry Manice (Vanderbilt, human & organizational development/economics) + Naveen Pawar (India, Madras Institute of Technology polymer tech, U Arkansas industrial engineering)
- **Origin**: Met 2010 at Alphatec Spine (medical device company) in San Diego
- **Initial Vision (2014)**: National craft beer brand, $100M revenue target (0.1% of $100B US beer market)
- **Strategy**: Contract manufacturing (von Trapp Brewery VT → Peabody Heights MD → Ipswich Ale MA)

**Financial History:**
- **Series A (2014)**: $2.4M raised for national brand growth
- **2016 Results**: $190K revenue, $1,088K net loss, $2.178M cash
- **Series A-1 (2016)**: $2.3M raised from 25 investors to pivot strategy
- **Current Burn**: $80K/month (expenses exceed gross profit)

**Strategic Pivot Decision (2016):**
- **From**: National brand, contract manufacturing, rapid scale
- **To**: Massachusetts-focused, owned brewery + taproom, local loyal following

**Reasons for Pivot:**
1. **Supply issues**: "Difficulties keeping all brands in stock due to limitations with contract brewing partners"
2. **Demand issues**: "Lack of taproom proving significant obstacle in engaging local community"
3. **Authenticity problem**: Not having home-state brewery = "lack of authenticity in eyes of customers and gatekeepers (bars, restaurants, retail)"
4. **Economics**:
   - Distribution gross margin lower than owned brewery
   - Missing taproom sales (90% gross margin vs 30% distribution)
   - Opportunity for fresher beer, higher prices, lower transport costs in Massachusetts

### Industry Landscape

**US Craft Beer Market (2016):**
- Total US beer market: $100B
- Nearly 6,000 craft breweries in US
- Vast majority: <1,000 barrels annual production

**Massachusetts Craft Brewery Leaders (2016):**
| Brewery | Founded | 2016 Sales (Barrels) | Taproom Location |
|---------|---------|---------------------|------------------|
| Jack's Abby | 2010 | 34,000 | Framingham |
| Lord Hobo | 2014 | 15,000 | Woburn |
| Wormtown | 2009 | 15,000 | Worcester |
| Tree House | 2010 | 13,000 | Charlton |
| Trillium | 2013 | 12,000 | Boston/Canton |
| Night Shift | 2010 | 10,000 | Boston/Everett |

**Taproom Economics:**
- Taproom gross margin: ~90%
- Distribution gross margin: ~30-40% (60% COGS)
- Taprooms = customer engagement + higher margins

### Timeline of Events
- **2010**: Henry and Naveen meet at Alphatec Spine, San Diego
- **2014**: Series A raise ($2.4M), launch national brand strategy, contract manufacturing begins
- **2015**: Beer launches on shelves
- **2016**:
  - Fall: Over 100 events, strong customer taste feedback
  - Challenges: Supply limitations, lack of taproom hurts authenticity
  - Dec: Series A-1 raise ($2.3M from 25 investors) to pivot to Massachusetts taproom
  - Financial results: $190K revenue, $1,088K net loss
- **Spring 2017**:
  - Search begins for brewery/taproom location (30+ candidates)
  - Downeast Cider Charlestown location considered (rejected: under bridge, off beaten track, might outgrow)
  - May: General contractor (Haynes Group) introduces Waltham Waverly Oaks site
- **Early Summer 2017**: Cambridge Fawcett Street alternative emerges
- **Late Fall 2017**: Decision point - negotiate Waltham lease terms, determine funding needs

## Key Protagonists

- **Henry Manice**: Co-founder, Mighty Squirrel
  - Background: Vanderbilt (human & organizational development, economics), previously co-founded enjuba clothing business (Uganda artisan goods)
  - Key decisions: Strategic pivot from national to local, site selection, funding strategy
  - Quote: "10-min from Cambridge, 20-min from Boston, center of many suburbs at Mass Pike/Route 95 intersection"

- **Naveen Pawar**: Co-founder, Mighty Squirrel
  - Background: Madras Institute of Technology (polymer tech), U Arkansas (industrial engineering), born in India
  - Key observation: "Launching without our own brewery has proven expensive - lower gross margins, no taproom sales (90% margin), focus on MA = fresher beer, higher prices, lower transport costs"

## Central Problem/Decision

### The Question
**How much additional funding does Mighty Squirrel need to complete the brewery and taproom at the Waltham site?**

### Assignment Questions (from Canvas):

1. **How is Mighty Squirrel doing? Do you support the strategic shift from a national brand with contract manufacturing to a Massachusetts brand with a local brewery and taproom?**

2. **How much additional funding does Mighty Squirrel need to complete the brewery and taproom at the Waltham site?** Assume that Mighty Squirrel will use the MassDevelopment Bank loan, and take Henry and Naveen's assumptions in **Table 6** (Exhibit 6) as a starting point.

3. **What should the founders do?**

### Waltham Site Key Terms (Waverly Oaks Business Park):

**Location Attributes:**
- 1.2M sq ft business park owned by Duffy family
- 5,000 sq ft main space (potential 5,000 sq ft sublease to Central Rock for climbing wall)
- Basement: room for fermenters/tanks, future expansion capacity
- Adjacent: 300-acre Beaver Brook Reservation (meadows, hiking/biking trails)
- Traffic: 2,000-3,000 people/day (medical/tech companies, restaurants, CrossFit, Athletic Club)
- Access: 10-min from Cambridge, 20-min from Boston, commuter rail + bus within walking distance
- Total usable space: ~18,000 sq ft
- Production capacity: 20,000-30,000 barrels annually

**Lease Terms (15 years + 2 extension options):**
1. **Rent**: $400K/year (net of Central Rock sublease), rising 2.25% annually
2. **Tenant Improvement (TI) Allowance**: $375K from landlord (8 bathrooms, HVAC, façade improvement)
3. **Security Deposit**: $350K (held by Duffy family, no interest, returned at lease end)

**Financing Options:**
1. **MassDevelopment Bank Loan**:
   - Up to $900K
   - 5% interest per annum
   - Secured by company assets (equipment) + personal guarantee from founders
   - Note: Commercial loans not available until profitability

2. **Series A-2 Equity Round**:
   - Potential $2M raise from existing investors
   - "Possible but far from assured"
   - Founders concerned about dilution

### Cambridge Alternative (135 Fawcett Street, Fresh Pond):

**Comparison:**
- Twin sheet-metal warehouses
- ~18,000 sq ft (same as Waltham)
- 20,000-30,000 barrels annual capacity (same as Waltham)
- **Pros**: Closer to city, familiar "Cambridge" name
- **Cons**: "Run down and industrial" section, perhaps "too industrial" for target crowd
- **Status**: Less advanced negotiations than Waltham, but potentially more generous TI allowance

### Pro Forma Assumptions (Exhibit 6):

**Revenue Forecast:**
| Year | Distribution | Taproom | Total |
|------|-------------|---------|-------|
| 2016 (Actual) | $189K | - | $189K |
| 2017 | $225K | - | $225K |
| 2018 | $700K | $500K | $1,200K |
| 2019 | $3,400K | $1,000K | $4,400K |
| 2020 | $5,000K | $1,250K | $6,250K |
| 2021 | $6,000K | $1,500K | $7,500K |

**Cost of Goods Sold:**
- Taproom: 10% of taproom sales
- Distribution: 60% of distribution sales

**Operating Expenses:**
| Expense Category | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |
|------------------|------|------|------|------|
| Brewery OpEx | $200K | $250K | $300K | $350K |
| Taproom OpEx | $80K | $200K | $250K | $300K |
| Rent | $400K | $409K | $418K | $427K |
| SG&A | $1,000K | $1,100K | $1,210K | $1,331K |

**Capital Expenditures:**
- **2018**: $2,500K total build-out
  - Less: $375K TI allowance from landlord
  - Net: $2,125K capitalized on Mighty Squirrel balance sheet
  - Equipment: $1,200K included in build-out
- **2019**: $100K ongoing capex
- **2020**: $1,000K (expansion to reach 2021 sales targets)
- **2021**: $100K ongoing capex

**Depreciation:**
- 2018: $130K
- 2019: $330K
- 2020: $310K
- 2021: $380K

**Taxes:**
- $2.465M in tax losses through 2016 (NOLs)
- Will eliminate tax liability through 2021 and beyond until accumulated net profits

**Working Capital Assumptions:**
- **Cash & Equivalents**: 1.5% of total revenue
- **Accounts Receivable**: 30-day payment terms for distribution revenue (30/365 × distribution revenue)
- **Inventory**: 10% of COGS
- **Accounts Payable**: 30-day payment terms on COGS (30/365 × COGS)
- **Accrued Expenses**: 6% of (operating expenses + SG&A)

**2021 Production Mix:**
- 1,000 barrels consumed in taproom
- 16,500 barrels sold through distribution
- Option: Contract brew for other breweries if own brand demand falls short

### Constraints
1. **Cash runway**: $2.178M cash (Dec 2016) burning $80K/month = ~27 months without additional revenue
2. **Equity dilution**: Founders want to avoid excessive dilution of current shareholders
3. **Funding uncertainty**: Series A-2 ($2M) "possible but far from assured"
4. **Profitability timeline**: Must reach profitability before running out of capital
5. **Construction timeline**: Must have sufficient capital to complete build-out
6. **Location decision**: Waltham vs Cambridge - different TI allowances, timing, market positioning

### Success Metrics
- **Peak funding need**: Total capital required to reach positive cash flow
- **Funding gap**: (Peak funding need) - (Available funding sources)
- **Buffer**: Excess capital beyond peak need to provide safety margin
- **Payback period**: Time to positive cash flow
- **Return on invested capital**: Value creation for equity investors

## Analysis

### SWOT Analysis

**Strengths:**
- **Strong product-market fit**: 100+ events in fall 2016, customers praise taste
- **Investor trust**: Transparent communication earned ability to raise Series A-2
- **Taproom economics**: 90% gross margin vs 30-40% distribution
- **Waltham location**: Excellent access (10-min Cambridge, 20-min Boston), 2,000-3,000 daily traffic, parking, expansion capacity
- **Favorable lease terms**: $375K TI allowance, enthusiastic landlords (spillover value as anchor tenant)
- **Experienced team**: Medical device background (product management), entrepreneurial track record (enjuba)

**Weaknesses:**
- **Severe cash burn**: $80K/month losses, only ~27 months runway without growth
- **Limited revenue**: $190K in 2016 (vs $100M original target)
- **Accumulated losses**: $2.465M through 2016
- **No profitability history**: Cannot access commercial bank loans
- **Dilution risk**: Multiple equity rounds (A, A-1, potential A-2) eroding founder ownership
- **Unproven pivot**: Taproom success uncertain, shifting from national to local strategy

**Opportunities:**
- **Taproom margin expansion**: 90% gross margin generates significant cash after reaching scale
- **Massachusetts market**: Fresher beer, higher prices, lower transport costs, local authenticity
- **Distribution margin improvement**: Own brewery = better gross margins than contract manufacturing
- **Brand authenticity**: Taproom solves "lack of authenticity" problem with customers and gatekeepers
- **Experimentation**: Control production = ability to innovate new beer concepts
- **Anchor tenant value**: Duffy family sees Mighty Squirrel as draw for other office park tenants

**Threats:**
- **Funding shortfall**: Series A-2 not guaranteed, running out of cash mid-construction = catastrophic
- **Competition**: 6,000 craft breweries in US, 6 major MA breweries already established
- **Revenue risk**: Pro forma assumes aggressive growth (2018: $1.2M → 2021: $7.5M)
- **Construction delays**: GC or permitting delays could increase capital needs
- **Lease obligations**: 15-year commitment with $400K/year rent rising 2.25% annually
- **Cambridge alternative**: May offer better TI allowance, closer to city (optionality risk)

## Financial Analysis

### Historical Performance (2016):
| Metric | Amount ($K) | % Revenue |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Revenue | $190 | 100% |
| COGS | $137 | 72% |
| Gross Profit | $53 | 28% |
| Rent | $48 | 25% |
| SG&A | $1,074 | 565% |
| EBITDA | ($1,069) | -563% |
| Depreciation | $19 | 10% |
| Operating Loss | ($1,088) | -573% |
| Net Loss | ($1,088) | -573% |

**Key Observations:**
- Gross margin: 28% (reflects contract manufacturing economics)
- SG&A = 565% of revenue (massive overhead relative to sales)
- Monthly cash burn: ~$80K ($1,069K EBITDA loss / 12 months ≈ $89K/month)

### Balance Sheet (Dec 2016):
| Assets | Amount ($K) | Liabilities & Equity | Amount ($K) |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Cash | $2,178 | Accounts Payable | $39 |
| Accounts Receivable | $9 | Accrued Expenses | $20 |
| Inventory | $51 | Current Liabilities | $59 |
| Current Assets | $2,238 | Paid-In Capital | $4,731 |
| PP&E (net) | $87 | Retained Earnings | ($2,465) |
| **Total Assets** | **$2,325** | Equity | $2,266 |
|  |  | **Total L&E** | **$2,325** |

**Key Observations:**
- Strong cash position: $2.178M (94% of current assets)
- Minimal working capital: $9K AR + $51K inventory - $59K liabilities = $1K
- Cumulative losses: $2.465M eroded from $4.731M paid-in capital
- Book value per dollar invested: $2,266 / $4,731 = 48 cents (52% value erosion)

### Pro Forma Revenue Growth Analysis:
**Taproom Revenue Trajectory:**
- 2018: $500K (6 months partial year)
- 2019: $1,000K (100% growth)
- 2020: $1,250K (25% growth)
- 2021: $1,500K (20% growth)
- **Implied barrels**: 1,000 barrels in 2021 taproom consumption

**Distribution Revenue Trajectory:**
- 2016: $189K (actual)
- 2017: $225K (19% growth)
- 2018: $700K (211% growth) - **aggressive**
- 2019: $3,400K (386% growth) - **very aggressive**
- 2020: $5,000K (47% growth)
- 2021: $6,000K (20% growth)
- **Implied barrels**: 16,500 barrels in 2021 distribution

**Red Flags:**
- 2018-2019 distribution growth (211% → 386%) assumes taproom significantly boosts distribution
- Total 2021 revenue ($7.5M) = 39x 2016 actual ($190K)
- Aggressive assumptions may overstate funding needs if growth slower

### Capital Requirements Analysis:

**Fixed Capital Needs:**
- Security deposit: $350K (returned at lease end, no interest)
- 2018 build-out: $2,500K - $375K TI = $2,125K net capex
- 2019 capex: $100K
- 2020 expansion: $1,000K
- 2021 capex: $100K
- **Total 2018-2021 capex**: $3,325K

**Working Capital Formula (from assumptions):**
- Cash = 1.5% × Total Revenue
- AR = (30/365) × Distribution Revenue
- Inventory = 10% × COGS
- AP = (30/365) × COGS
- Accrued Expenses = 6% × (OpEx + SG&A)
- **Net Working Capital = Cash + AR + Inventory - AP - Accrued Expenses**

**[Working capital calculation requires Excel template - to be filled in spreadsheet]**

### Funding Sources Available:

1. **Cash on hand (Dec 2016)**: $2,178K
2. **MassDevelopment Bank Loan**: $900K at 5% interest
3. **Series A-2 Equity**: $2,000K (potential, not assured)
4. **Operating cash flows**: From operations 2018-2021 (if positive)

**Maximum funding available**: $2,178K + $900K + $2,000K = $5,078K
**Less: Security deposit tied up**: $350K
**Net available for operations/capex**: $4,728K

### Key Questions for Analysis:

1. **What is the peak funding need?** (Requires pro forma cash flow model)
2. **When does Mighty Squirrel reach positive cash flow?**
3. **Is $900K bank loan + $2M equity sufficient?**
4. **What buffer exists beyond peak need?**
5. **What are the break-even assumptions?** (Revenue, margins, timing)
6. **How sensitive is funding need to revenue growth assumptions?**

### Question 2: Funding Needs Calculation

**[To be completed in Excel template - Mighty Squirrel Template.xlsx]**

**Approach:**
1. Build pro forma income statement (2017-2021) using Exhibit 6 assumptions
2. Calculate depreciation schedule for capex
3. Calculate working capital changes year-over-year
4. Build cash flow statement:
   - Operating cash flow = NI + Depreciation - ΔWC
   - Investing cash flow = - Capex
   - Financing cash flow = Debt/Equity proceeds - Interest payments
5. Calculate cumulative cash position to identify peak funding need

**Key Formula:**
```
Peak Funding Need = Maximum Cumulative Cash Deficit
Additional Funding = Peak Need - Cash on Hand (Dec 2016)
```

**Preliminary Estimate:**
- [To be filled after Excel analysis]

**Sensitivity Analysis:**
- Revenue growth slower than forecast
- Capex overruns
- Working capital higher than assumed

### Question 3: What should the founders do?
