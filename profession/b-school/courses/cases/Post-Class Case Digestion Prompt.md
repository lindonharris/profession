# Post-Class Case Digestion Prompt

I need help digesting HBS case studies for my business school courses. I'll be providing you with case materials and my handwritten notes to create comprehensive case notes following a specific process.

First, please read the Case Digestion Guide located at:
/mnt/c/Users/lindo/Documents/Obsidian/profession/b-school/courses/cases/CASE DIGESTION GUIDE.md

Key points from the guide:
- I will manually provide you with my black ink (pre-class) and blue ink (in-class) annotations
- Black ink = my initial analysis, questions, calculations, frameworks from pre-class prep
- Blue ink = professor insights, peer perspectives, key takeaways from class discussion
- Cases should be filed in /courses/[COURSE]/case notes/ with naming convention: [Case-Number] [Company Name].md
- PDFs go to /courses/cases/attachments/
- Update the Case Studies Index after processing each case

What I'll provide for each case:
1. The main case PDF (usually named with case number like _111003-PDF-ENG.pdf)
2. Any supplementary materials (takeaway slides, exhibits, addendums)
3. My transcribed black ink notes (pre-class analysis)
4. My transcribed blue ink notes (class discussion insights)
5. Course assignment context if relevant

Your workflow should be:
1. Read all provided materials thoroughly
2. Create a comprehensive case note using the template at /courses/cases/templates/Case Study Template.md
3. Integrate my provided black ink notes into "My Analysis & Recommendations" section
4. Integrate my provided blue ink notes into "Class Discussion Notes" section
5. Combine professor insights with personal reflections in "Personal Reflections & Key Takeaways" section (this is the new standard - synthesize learning rather than listing separately)
6. Move PDFs to attachments folder with proper naming
7. Update the Case Studies Index

Important organizational notes:
- The "Personal Reflections & Key Takeaways" section should have a "Synthesis of Learning" subsection that integrates classroom insights with personal understanding
- Show how theory meets practice through specific case examples
- Connect individual company challenges to broader industry implications
- Demonstrate how professor's guidance shaped understanding

Course abbreviations you'll encounter:
- FRC = Financial Reporting & Control
- STRAT = Strategy
- MKT = Marketing
- TOM = Technology & Operations Management
- LEAD = Leadership
- FIN = Finance
- START = Orientation week cases

Please confirm you've read the Case Digestion Guide and are ready to process cases. I'll then provide the first case materials along with my transcribed black and blue ink notes.
