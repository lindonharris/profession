# Post-Class Case Archive Processing Notes

## Quick Reference for Archiving Completed Cases

When LinDon sends a marked-up case PDF AFTER CLASS, follow this archive protocol:

### 1. Identify Annotation Types
- **Black ink** = Pre-class prep (goes in "My Analysis" section)
- **Blue ink** = Class discussion (goes in "Class Discussion Notes")  
- **Final/back page** = Takeaways (goes in "Personal Reflections")

### 2. Extract in This Order
1. **Case metadata** from header (case number, title, date)
2. **Original questions** from the case
3. **Black ink annotations**:
   - Margin notes
   - Underlined/highlighted text with annotations
   - Calculations and frameworks
   - Questions LinDon wrote
4. **Blue ink annotations**:
   - Professor quotes
   - Alternative viewpoints
   - Corrections to initial analysis
   - Additional frameworks from class
5. **Final page takeaways**:
   - Numbered insights
   - Application notes
   - Connections to other cases

### 3. Archive into Template Sections

#### My Analysis & Recommendations
- All black ink pre-class work (already completed by LinDon)
- Initial frameworks applied
- Original calculations
- First-pass recommendations

#### Class Discussion Notes  
- All blue ink additions from class
- "Prof said..." notes
- "Student X argued..." perspectives
- Corrections and refinements to initial analysis

#### Personal Reflections
- Final page takeaways (LinDon's synthesis)
- Key learnings from the case
- Applications to other situations
- Remaining questions

### 4. Special Handling

#### For Financial Data
- If calculations appear in black = LinDon's analysis
- If calculations appear in blue = class corrections/additions
- Create clean tables in the Financial Analysis section

#### For Frameworks
- Black ink frameworks = initial application
- Blue ink frameworks = additional/corrected in class
- Note which frameworks were most useful

#### For Exhibits
- Reference specific exhibit numbers
- Note which exhibits LinDon marked most heavily
- Include exhibit insights in relevant sections

### 5. Index Updates
After archiving the case:
- Add to Central Case Studies Index
- Update course-specific index if it exists
- Add to industry category
- Add to geographic region
- Tag with key themes from class discussion
- Note if marked as "exam relevant" or "particularly important"

### 6. Archive Quality Checks
- ✓ All three annotation types captured (black, blue, final page)
- ✓ Case number matches filename
- ✓ Class insights properly distinguished from pre-class work
- ✓ Takeaways reflect both preparation and class learning
- ✓ Indexes updated

### 7. Important Reminders
- This is a POST-CLASS archive, not a prep tool
- LinDon does all preparation manually
- Our role is to preserve and organize completed work
- The archive serves as reference for exams and future learning
