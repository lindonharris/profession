# Archived Documentation

## Why These Files Were Archived
On 2025-09-02, the case processing system was streamlined from 6+ documents to a single comprehensive guide.

## Archived Files
- **Case Studies README.md** - Original comprehensive system documentation (superseded by CASE DIGESTION GUIDE.md)
- **PROCESSING_NOTES.md** - Detailed processing steps (merged into CASE DIGESTION GUIDE.md)
- **ANNOTATION_STATUS.md** - Case tracking system (no longer needed with incoming folder workflow)

## Current System
All agent instructions are now in: `/courses/cases/CASE DIGESTION GUIDE.md`

## Note
These files are kept for reference only. Do not use for processing cases.
