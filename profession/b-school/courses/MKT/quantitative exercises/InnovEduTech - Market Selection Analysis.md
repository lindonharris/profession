### Option 1: Math Tutoring for Elementary Students
- **Target**: First-grade students in US elementary schools
- **Price**: $60/year subscription
- **Market Sizing**:
  - 67,000 elementary schools × 500 first-graders = 33.5M total students
  - 20% addressable market = 6.7M potential customers
- **Customer Economics**:
  - CAC: $95
  - Retention: 5-year duration (elementary school)
  - Support costs: $20,000 per 1,000 users

### Option 2: Ancient Languages Tutoring for Adults
- **Target**: Global adult language learners
- **Price**: $200/year subscription
- **Market Sizing**:
  - 1M interested individuals globally
  - 10% addressable = 100,000 potential customers
- **Customer Economics**:
  - CAC: $250
  - Retention: 60% annual rate
  - Support costs: $32,000 per 1,000 users

## Quantitative Analysis

### Question 1: Math Tutoring Market Size
**Calculation**: 67,000 schools × 500 students × 20% penetration = 6.7M students
**Answer**: b. Between 5 and 7 million students

### Question 2: Ancient Languages LTV
**Calculation with 60% annual retention (discount rate = 0%)**:
- Average customer lifetime = 1 / (1 - 0.6) = 2.5 years
- Revenue per year = $200
- Support cost per year = $32
- Net revenue per year = $200 - $32 = $168
- LTV = $168 × 2.5 = $420

**Answer**: b. $420

### Question 3: Net Profitability Comparison (LTV - CAC)

**Math Tutoring**:
- Revenue: $60 × 5 years = $300
- Support costs: $20 × 5 = $100
- LTV = $300 - $100 = $200
- Net profit = $200 - $95 = $105

**Ancient Languages**:
- LTV = $420 (calculated above)
- Net profit = $420 - $250 = $170

**Answer**: b. Ancient languages tutoring service for adults

### Question 4: LTV/CAC Ratio Comparison

**Math Tutoring**: $200 / $95 = 2.11

**Ancient Languages**: $420 / $250 = 1.68

**Answer**: a. Math tutoring service for elementary school children

### Question 5: Metric Selection (ROI vs LTV/CAC)

Both metrics lead to the same conclusion in this case:
- LTV/CAC: Math tutoring (2.11) > Ancient languages (1.68)
- ROI (as measured by (LTV-CAC)/CAC):
  - Math: ($200-$95)/$95 = 110.5%
  - Ancient: ($420-$250)/$250 = 68%

Both metrics favor math tutoring, making the choice clear regardless of which metric is used.

**Answer**: c. It does not matter. Both metrics would lead to the same managerial conclusion

## Key Insights

### Market Attractiveness Factors

**Math Tutoring Strengths**:
- Large addressable market (6.7M potential customers)

## Recommendation Framework

The decision should prioritize:
1. **Capital Efficiency**: If limited resources → Math (better LTV/CAC)
2. **Profitability Focus**: If seeking higher margins → Ancient Languages
3. **Scale Ambitions**: If pursuing market leadership → Math
4. **Differentiation Strategy**: If avoiding competition → Ancient Languages

## Learning Points

1. **LTV/CAC vs ROI**: Different metrics can lead to different strategic choices
2. **Market Size vs Margins**: Classic trade-off in market selection
3. **Support Costs Matter**: Per-user service costs significantly impact unit economics
4. **Retention Dynamics**: Multi-year retention (math) vs renewal rates (languages) create different value profiles
5. **CAC Efficiency**: Lower CAC can compensate for lower pricing in unit economics
