## Overview
The goal of marketing is to grow a business by providing value to customers. Key decisions include identifying market opportunities, selecting target segments, launching new products, pricing, channel selection, and advertising.

## 1. Market Size Estimation

### Two Approaches

#### Top-Down Approach
Use industry estimates of comparable products.

**Example: Airbnb**
- Competitor (Couchsurfing) had 630,000 users
- Total global market: 1.9 billion trips
- Available market (budget/online): 532 million trips
- Expected share: 2% = 10.6 million trips
- Revenue calculation: 10.6M trips × 3 nights × $70/night × 10% commission = $200M annual revenue

**Example: Careem (Dubai ride-hailing)**
- Dubai taxi market: $500-525M
- Dubai limo market: $100M
- Dubai = 50% of UAE market
- UAE = 30% of GCC market
- Total GCC market opportunity: >$4 billion

#### Bottom-Up Approach
Build up market size by breaking into components.

**Example: Mint (personal finance)**
- Target population (22-35 years): 49 million
- Use online banking: 64%
- Prospective users: 31 million
- Revenue per user from referrals: $8/year
- Revenue per user from advertising: $4.50/year
- Total market potential: 31M × $12.50 = $388 million

## 2. Customer Value

### Total Economic Value (TEV)
TEV = Difference in total cost of ownership between new and old products

**Example: LED vs Incandescent Bulbs (2013)**
| Metric | LED | Incandescent |
|--------|-----|--------------|
| Lifespan | 50,000 hours | 1,200 hours |
| Watts | 10 | 60 |
| Price | $35.95 | $1.25 |
| Electricity cost (50k hrs) | $50 | $300 |
| Bulbs needed (50k hrs) | 1 | 42 |
| Total cost (50k hrs) | $85.95 | $352.50 |
| **TEV of LED** | **$266.55** | |

## 3. Demand Generation & Customer Acquisition

### Price Promotion - Breakeven Analysis

**Formula**: BEV = Fixed Cost / Contribution Margin per Unit

**Example: Domino's BOGO Promotion**
- Regular price: $5.99
- Variable cost: $1.99
- Contribution margin per pizza: $4.00
- Margin per BOGO order: $4.00 - $1.99 = $2.01
- Fixed promotion cost: $5,000
- Breakeven volume: $5,000 / $2 = 2,500 orders

### Digital Marketing Analysis

**Example: Away Luggage Facebook Ads**
- Ad budget: $15,000/month
- CPM: $15 per thousand impressions
- CTR: 1%
- Conversion rate: 2%
- Average order: $250
- Variable cost: $100

**Calculations:**
- Impressions: 1 million
- Clicks: 10,000
- Orders: 200
- Gross profit: 200 × $150 = $30,000
- Net profit: $30,000 - $15,000 = $15,000
- CAC: $75
- ROAS: 3.33
- ROI: 100%

## 4. Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

### Basic Formula
**LTV = m × LT**

Where:
- m = annual contribution margin
- LT = expected lifetime = 1/(1-r) = 1/churn rate
- r = annual retention rate

**Example: Disney+**
- Annual revenue per customer: $60
- Annual retention rate: 80%
- Churn rate: 20%
- Expected lifetime: 1/0.20 = 5 years
- LTV: $60 × 5 = $300
- If CAC = $150, then LTV - CAC = $150

### LTV/CAC Ratio
- Must be >1 for positive ROI
- SaaS companies target >3 as rule of thumb

### Advanced LTV (with discount rate)
**LTV = m / (1 - r + i)**

Where i = discount rate/cost of capital

## 5. Go-to-Market Strategy

### Channel Economics

**Example: Allbirds Shoes**
- Retail price: $100
- Retailer margin: 30% = $30
- Wholesale price: $70
- Wholesaler margin: 20% = $14
- Manufacturer selling price: $56
- COGS: $36
- **Manufacturer gross margin: $20 (36%)**

**DTC Economics:**
- Revenue: $100
- COGS: $36
- Gross margin: $64 (64%)
- BUT must subtract:
  - CAC: $30
  - Fulfillment: $15
- **Net profit: $15**

Conclusion: Despite higher gross margin, DTC may be less profitable due to CAC and fulfillment costs.

### Trade Promotions

**Example: Coca-Cola $1 off per case**
- Retail price: $8.00
- Retail margin: 30% = $2.40
- Retailer COGS: $5.60
- With $1 discount, COGS becomes $4.60

Retailer choices:
1. Pass through: Sell at $7, maintain $2.40 margin
2. Pocket discount: Sell at $8, increase margin to $3.40 (42% increase)

Retailer passes through only if volume increases >42% from 12.5% price cut.

## 6. Market Share Analysis

### Market Share Breakdown
**Market Share = % Awareness × % Trial × % Repeat Rate**

**Example:**
- 80% awareness × 40% trial × 20% repeat = 6.4% market share

Actions based on diagnosis:
- Low awareness → Brand advertising
- Low trial → Free samples/freemium
- Low repeat → Product improvement

## 7. Pricing Strategy

### Impact of Price on Profit
McKinsey study (2,500 companies):
- 1% price increase → 11.1% profit increase
- 1% volume increase → 3.3% profit increase
- 1% variable cost reduction → 7.8% profit increase

### Breakeven Volume for Price Changes

| Price Change | Margin Impact | Volume Needed to Breakeven |
|--------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| -20% | $80 → $20 | 2x current volume |
| -10% | $90 → $30 | 1.33x current volume |
| +10% | $110 → $50 | 0.8x current volume |
| +20% | $120 → $60 | 0.67x current volume |

*Assumes $100 price, $60 variable cost baseline*

### Price Elasticity
**Formula**: % Change in Volume / % Change in Price

Average for CPG brands: -2.62

Methods to estimate:
1. Historical data/regression
2. Conjoint analysis
3. Experiments (e.g., Amazon pricing tests)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Market Sizing**: Use both top-down and bottom-up approaches for validation
2. **Customer Value**: Quantify TEV but remember perception matters
3. **CAC vs LTV**: Ensure LTV > CAC; aim for LTV/CAC > 3 for SaaS
4. **Channel Strategy**: Compare total economics, not just margins
5. **Pricing Power**: Small price changes have outsized profit impact
6. **Market Share**: Diagnose awareness vs trial vs repeat issues
7. **Analysis Sequence**: Qualitative → Quantitative → Qualitative ("so what?")
