- CTR: 1.5%
- Conversion rate: 3%
- AOV: $150
- Variable cost: $50

**Calculate:** CAC, ROAS, ROI, and profitability

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**Step 1: Calculate metrics**
- Impressions: ($20,000/$12) √ó 1,000 = 1,666,667
- Clicks: 1,666,667 √ó 0.015 = 25,000
- Orders: 25,000 √ó 0.03 = 750
- Revenue: 750 √ó $150 = $112,500
- Gross profit: 750 √ó ($150-$50) = $75,000

**Step 2: Key metrics**
- CAC = $20,000 / 750 = **$26.67**
- ROAS = $112,500 / $20,000 = **5.63**
- ROI = ($75,000 - $20,000) / $20,000 = **275%**
- Net profit = $75,000 - $20,000 = **$55,000**

</details>

- Monthly price: $25
- Monthly COGS: $12
- Monthly retention: 90%
- CAC: $45

**Calculate:** LTV, LTV/CAC ratio, and months to payback

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**Monthly calculations:**
- Monthly margin: $25 - $12 = $13
- Monthly churn: 1 - 0.90 = 0.10
- LTV = $13 / 0.10 = **$130**
- LTV/CAC = $130 / $45 = **2.89**
- Payback = $45 / $13 = **3.5 months**

</details>

### Problem 7: Improving Unit Economics ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
Your SaaS company has:
- Monthly revenue per user: $100
- Gross margin: 80%
- Annual retention: 85%
- CAC: $500

You can either:
A) Reduce CAC by 20% (optimize marketing)
B) Improve retention to 90% (better onboarding)
C) Increase price 10% (lose 5% of customers)

**Question:** Which option maximizes LTV/CAC?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**Current state:**
- Annual margin: $100 √ó 12 √ó 0.80 = $960
- LTV = $960 / (1-0.85) = $6,400
- LTV/CAC = $6,400 / $500 = 12.8

**Option A (Reduce CAC 20%):**
- New CAC: $400
- LTV/CAC = $6,400 / $400 = **16.0**

**Option B (Retention to 90%):**
- New LTV = $960 / (1-0.90) = $9,600
- LTV/CAC = $9,600 / $500 = **19.2**

**Option C (Price +10%, Volume -5%):**
- New revenue: $110 √ó 0.95 = $104.50
- New margin: $104.50 √ó 12 √ó 0.80 = $1,003.20
- LTV = $1,003.20 / 0.15 = $6,688
- LTV/CAC = $6,688 / $500 = **13.4**

**Best option: B (Improve retention) with LTV/CAC of 19.2**

## üè™ CHANNEL ECONOMICS PROBLEMS

### Problem 8: Retail vs. DTC Decision ‚≠ê‚≠ê
Your sustainable water bottle company evaluates channels:

**Retail channel:**
- MSRP: $40
- Retailer margin: 40%
- Your COGS: $8

**DTC channel:**
- Sell at MSRP: $40
- COGS: $8
- Shipping: $5
- CAC: $15

**Question:** Which channel is more profitable per unit?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**Retail channel:**
- Retailer takes: $40 √ó 0.40 = $16
- You receive: $40 - $16 = $24
- Your margin: $24 - $8 = **$16**

**DTC channel:**
- Revenue: $40
- Total costs: $8 + $5 + $15 = $28
- Your margin: $40 - $28 = **$12**

**Retail is more profitable by $4 per unit**

</details>

### Problem 9: Trade Promotion Pass-Through ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
Coca-Cola offers retailers $2 off per 12-pack case:
- Current retail price: $6.00
- Retailer margin: 25%
- Retailer's current margin per case: $1.50

**Question:** What sales increase does retailer need to justify passing the full discount to consumers?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**Current state:**
- Margin: $6.00 √ó 0.25 = $1.50
- COGS: $6.00 - $1.50 = $4.50

**With $2 manufacturer discount:**
- New COGS: $4.50 - $2.00 = $2.50

**Option 1: Keep price, pocket discount**
- Margin: $6.00 - $2.50 = $3.50
- Margin increase: $3.50/$1.50 = 133% increase

**Option 2: Pass full discount**
- New price: $4.00
- New margin: $4.00 - $2.50 = $1.50 (same)
- Price reduction: $2/$6 = 33%

**Retailer needs 133% volume increase to justify passing discount**
(Unlikely, so retailer will probably pocket most of it)

## üí≤ PRICING STRATEGY PROBLEMS

### Problem 10: Price Elasticity Calculation ‚≠ê
Last month you sold 10,000 units at $50. This month you raised price to $55 and sold 8,500 units.

**Calculate:** Price elasticity and interpret

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

- Price change: ($55-$50)/$50 = 10%
- Volume change: (8,500-10,000)/10,000 = -15%
- Elasticity = -15% / 10% = **-1.5**

**Interpretation:** For every 1% price increase, volume decreases 1.5%

</details>

### Problem 11: Optimal Pricing Decision ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
Your premium coffee brand has:
- Current price: $20/bag
- Current volume: 100,000 bags/month
- Variable cost: $8/bag
- Fixed costs: $500,000/month
- Price elasticity: -2.0

You're considering a 15% price cut to gain share.

**Question:** Should you cut price? What's the profit impact?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**Current profit:**
- Revenue: $20 √ó 100,000 = $2,000,000
- Variable costs: $8 √ó 100,000 = $800,000
- Contribution: $1,200,000
- Profit: $1,200,000 - $500,000 = **$700,000**

**With 15% price cut:**
- New price: $20 √ó 0.85 = $17
- Volume increase: 15% √ó 2.0 = 30%
- New volume: 100,000 √ó 1.30 = 130,000
- Revenue: $17 √ó 130,000 = $2,210,000
- Variable costs: $8 √ó 130,000 = $1,040,000
- Contribution: $1,170,000
- Profit: $1,170,000 - $500,000 = **$670,000**

**Decision: Don't cut price. Profit decreases by $30,000**

## üìä MARKET SHARE PROBLEMS

### Problem 12: Diagnosing Low Market Share ‚≠ê‚≠ê
Your protein bar brand has 2% market share. Research shows:
- Awareness: 40%
- Trial (among aware): 20%
- Repeat (among trial): 25%

**Questions:** 
1. Calculate theoretical market share
2. What's the biggest opportunity?
3. If you double trial rate, what's new share?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

1. **Theoretical share** = 0.40 √ó 0.20 √ó 0.25 = **2%** (matches actual)

2. **Biggest opportunity:** 
   - Awareness is lowest at 40%
   - If doubled to 80%: Share = 0.80 √ó 0.20 √ó 0.25 = **4%**

3. **Double trial rate (to 40%):**
   - New share = 0.40 √ó 0.40 √ó 0.25 = **4%**

**Both awareness and trial offer equal opportunity to double share**

4. Is this an attractive opportunity?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**1. TAM Calculation:**
- Suburban homes: 130M √ó 0.40 = 52M
- High security concern: 52M √ó 0.30 = 15.6M
- Tech-savvy: 15.6M √ó 0.50 = 7.8M
- Would consider: 7.8M √ó 0.20 = 1.56M households
- TAM = 1.56M √ó $299 = **$466M** (devices)

**2. LTV Calculation:**
- Device margin: $299 - $120 - $50 = $129 (one-time)
- Monthly service margin: $29 - $5 = $24
- Annual service margin: $24 √ó 12 = $288
- Service LTV: $288 / (1-0.85) = $1,920
- Total LTV: $129 + $1,920 = **$2,049**

**3. LTV/CAC Ratio:**
- LTV/CAC = $2,049 / $150 = **13.7**

**4. Attractiveness:**
- ‚úÖ Large TAM ($466M devices + recurring revenue)
- ‚úÖ Excellent LTV/CAC ratio (13.7 >> 3)
- ‚úÖ High margins on recurring revenue
- ‚úÖ Strong unit economics

**This is a very attractive opportunity**
