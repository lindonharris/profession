**What are the main customer personas (or "archetypes") you see in the data?**

Analysis:

4 distinct personas identified in the customer base
```

### Question 2: Segmentation Variables
**Which variables would you include to create these customer personas? Why those?**

Key Variables to Consider:

My Answer:

```

### Question 3: Optimal Number of Segments

```
