## üìä 1. MARKET SIZING

### Top-Down Approach
Start with industry estimates ‚Üí narrow to your target
- **Total Addressable Market (TAM)**: Total market potential
- **Total Available Market**: Your product-market fit
- **Market Share**: What you can realistically capture

#### Example: Airbnb
- Global hotel/B&B market: 1.9B trips
- Budget + online segment: 532M trips  
- Target share (2%): 10.6M trips
- Revenue = Trips √ó Nights √ó Price √ó Commission
- Revenue = 10.6M √ó 3 √ó $70 √ó 10% = $200M

### Bottom-Up Approach
Build up from components:
**Market Size = (# of customers) √ó (units per customer) √ó (price per unit)**

#### Example: Mint
- Target population (22-35 years): 49M
- Online banking users (64%): 31M
- Revenue per user: $8 (referral) + $4.50 (ads) = $12.50
- Market potential = 31M √ó $12.50 = $388M

## üí∞ 2. CUSTOMER VALUE

### Total Economic Value (TEV)
**TEV = Total Cost of Old Product - Total Cost of New Product**

Where Total Cost includes:
- Initial purchase price
- Usage/maintenance costs
- Time/convenience costs

#### Example: LED vs. Incandescent Bulb
- Incandescent (50,000 hrs): $352.50 total
- LED (50,000 hrs): $85.95 total
- TEV of LED = $352.50 - $85.95 = **$266.55**

---

## üìà 3. DEMAND GENERATION & CUSTOMER ACQUISITION

### Breakeven Analysis

**Breakeven Volume (BEV) = Fixed Cost / Contribution Margin per Unit**

#### Example: Domino's BOGO Promotion
- Fixed cost: $5,000
- Price per pizza: $5.99
- Variable cost: $1.99
- Margin per pizza: $4.00
- Margin per BOGO order: $5.99 - $1.99 - $1.99 = $2.00
- BEV = $5,000 / $2 = **2,500 orders**

### Digital Marketing Metrics

#### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
**CAC = Total Ad Spend / Number of New Customers**

#### Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)
**ROAS = Incremental Revenue / Ad Spend**
- Typical range: 2-4x

#### Return on Investment (ROI)
**ROI = (Incremental Gross Profit - Ad Spend) / Ad Spend**

#### Digital Marketing Funnel
1. **Impressions** = Ad Budget / CPM √ó 1,000
2. **Clicks** = Impressions √ó CTR
3. **Orders** = Clicks √ó Conversion Rate
4. **Revenue** = Orders √ó Average Order Value
5. **Profit** = Revenue - Cost - Ad Spend

#### Example: Away Luggage Facebook Ads
- Ad budget: $15,000
- CPM: $15
- Impressions: 1,000,000
- CTR: 1% ‚Üí 10,000 clicks
- Conversion: 2% ‚Üí 200 orders
- AOV: $250, Cost: $100
- Margin: $150 √ó 200 = $30,000
- Net profit: $30,000 - $15,000 = **$15,000**
- CAC = $15,000 / 200 = **$75**
- ROAS = $50,000 / $15,000 = **3.33**
- ROI = $15,000 / $15,000 = **100%**

---

## üîÑ 4. CUSTOMER LIFETIME VALUE (LTV)

### Simple LTV Formula (No Discounting)
**LTV = m √ó LT**

Where:
- m = annual contribution margin
- LT = expected lifetime in years

**LT = 1 / (1 - r) = 1 / Churn Rate**

Where r = annual retention rate

### LTV with Time Value of Money
**LTV = m / (1 - r + i)**

Where i = discount rate

### Key Metrics
- **LTV/CAC Ratio**: Should be > 1 for profitability
  - SaaS companies target > 3
- **ROI on Customer Acquisition** = (LTV - CAC) / CAC

#### Example: Disney+
- Annual margin: $60
- Retention rate: 80% (churn: 20%)
- Expected lifetime: 1/0.20 = 5 years
- LTV = $60 √ó 5 = **$300**
- If CAC = $150:
  - LTV/CAC = 2.0
  - ROI = ($300-$150)/$150 = 100%

## üè™ 5. CHANNEL ECONOMICS

### Margin Calculations

**Retailer Margin % = (RSP - WSP) / RSP**
**Wholesaler Margin % = (WSP - MSP) / WSP**
**Manufacturer Margin % = (MSP - COGS) / MSP**

Where:
- RSP = Retail Selling Price
- WSP = Wholesale Selling Price
- MSP = Manufacturer Selling Price
- COGS = Cost of Goods Sold

### Channel Margin Stacking
Working backwards from consumer price:
1. Start with RSP
2. Subtract retailer margin ‚Üí WSP
3. Subtract wholesaler margin ‚Üí MSP
4. Subtract COGS ‚Üí Manufacturer profit

#### Example: Allbirds Shoes
- RSP: $100
- Retailer margin (30%): $30
- WSP: $70
- Wholesaler margin (20% of $70): $14
- MSP: $56
- COGS: $36
- **Manufacturer margin: $20 (36%)**

### Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) vs. Retail
DTC Advantages:
- Higher gross margin (capture full RSP)
- Direct customer relationship

DTC Disadvantages:
- Higher CAC
- Fulfillment costs
- Customer service costs

**DTC Profit = RSP - COGS - CAC - Fulfillment**
**Retail Profit = MSP - COGS**

## üí≤ 6. PRICING STRATEGY

### Price Elasticity
**Price Elasticity = % Change in Volume / % Change in Price**
- Average for CPG brands: -2.62

### Breakeven Volume After Price Change
For price reduction:
**BEV Multiplier = Old Margin / New Margin**

#### Quick Reference Table
| Price Change | Volume Needed to Breakeven* |
|-------------|----------------------------|
| -10% | +33% |
| -20% | +100% |
| +10% | Can lose up to 20% |
| +20% | Can lose up to 33% |
*Assumes 40% initial margin

### Impact on Profit (McKinsey Study)
- 1% price increase ‚Üí 11.1% profit increase
- 1% volume increase ‚Üí 3.3% profit increase
- 1% variable cost reduction ‚Üí 7.8% profit increase
- 1% fixed cost reduction ‚Üí 2.3% profit increase

### Trade Promotions
**Pass-Through Decision:**
Retailer passes discount if:
**Expected Volume Increase % > Current Margin % / (Current Margin % - Discount %)**

---

## üìä 7. MARKET SHARE ANALYSIS

**Market Share = Awareness √ó Trial √ó Repeat Rate**

### Diagnosis Framework
- **Low Awareness** ‚Üí Increase advertising
- **Low Trial** (with high awareness) ‚Üí Offer samples/trials
- **Low Repeat** ‚Üí Improve product/experience

#### Example
- Awareness: 80%
- Trial: 40% 
- Repeat: 20%
- Market Share = 0.80 √ó 0.40 √ó 0.20 = **6.4%**

---

## üîÑ 8. PRODUCT LINE EXPANSION

### Cannibalization Analysis
Compare LTV of products:
**Net Impact = (LTV_new √ó Volume_new) - (LTV_lost √ó Volume_cannibalized)**

#### Example: Economist Print vs. Digital
- Print: Margin $151, Retention 60%, LTV = $378
- Digital: Margin $95, Retention 90%, LTV = $950
- Conclusion: Digital cannibalization is beneficial

---

## üìù KEY DECISION RULES

### When to Cut Price
Only if: **Price Elasticity > (Old Margin % / Price Cut %)**

### When to Acquire Customers
Only if: **LTV > CAC**
- For SaaS: LTV/CAC > 3

### When to Use Retail Channel
If: **Retail Margin < (DTC CAC + Fulfillment Costs)**

### When to Expand Product Line
If: **Incremental Revenue > Cannibalization Loss + Brand Dilution Cost**

---

## üéØ QUICK CALCULATIONS

### Rule of 72
Years to double = 72 / growth rate %

### Margin Quick Math
- If margin = 40%, need 2.5√ó volume to offset 10% price cut
- If margin = 20%, need 5√ó volume to offset 10% price cut

### SaaS Metrics
- Monthly to Annual: Multiply by 12 (revenue) or compound retention
- Payback Period = CAC / (Monthly Revenue √ó Gross Margin)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

1. **Ignoring Retention** in LTV calculations
2. **Double-counting** in market sizing
3. **Forgetting Fixed Costs** in breakeven analysis
4. **Assuming 100% Attribution** in digital marketing
5. **Neglecting Cannibalization** in line extensions
6. **Using Revenue instead of Margin** in ROI calculations
7. **Mixing Time Periods** (monthly vs. annual) in formulas
