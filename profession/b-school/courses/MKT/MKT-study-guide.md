## üìä Marketing Analytics Toolkit

### 1. Market Sizing

#### Top-Down Approach
```
TAM (Total Addressable Market)
    ‚Üì
SAM (Serviceable Available Market)
    ‚Üì
SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)

Market Size = TAM √ó % Addressable √ó % Penetration √ó Market Share
```

#### Bottom-Up Approach
```
Market Size = # Customers √ó Purchase Frequency √ó Average Transaction Value
```

### 2. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

#### Simple CLV
```
CLV = (Average Purchase Value √ó Purchase Frequency √ó Customer Lifespan) - Customer Acquisition Cost
```

#### Discounted CLV Formula
```
CLV = Œ£(t=1 to T) [(Revenuet - Costt) √ó Retentiont] / (1 + d)^t - CAC

Where:
- t = time period
- d = discount rate
- CAC = Customer Acquisition Cost
```

#### CLV/CAC Ratio Benchmarks
- **< 1.0**: Losing money on customers
- **1.0-3.0**: Healthy for most businesses
- **> 3.0**: May be under-investing in growth

### 3. Pricing Analytics

#### Price Elasticity
```
Price Elasticity = % Change in Quantity / % Change in Price

Elastic (|E| > 1): Price sensitive
Inelastic (|E| < 1): Price insensitive
```

#### Break-Even Analysis
```
Break-Even Volume = Fixed Costs / (Price - Variable Cost per Unit)
Break-Even Market Share = Break-Even Volume / Market Size
```

#### Contribution Margin
```
Contribution Margin = (Price - Variable Cost) / Price
```

### 4. Digital Marketing Metrics

#### Customer Acquisition
| Metric | Formula | Benchmark |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **CAC** | Marketing Spend / New Customers | Varies by industry |
| **CPM** | Cost per 1000 Impressions | $5-50 |
| **CPC** | Cost per Click | $0.50-5.00 |
| **CPA** | Cost per Acquisition | < CLV/3 |
| **Conversion Rate** | Conversions / Visitors | 2-5% |

#### Engagement Metrics
| Metric | Formula | Good Performance |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| **CTR** | Clicks / Impressions | > 2% |
| **Bounce Rate** | Single Page Visits / Total | < 40% |
| **Engagement Rate** | Engagements / Impressions | > 3% |
| **NPS** | % Promoters - % Detractors | > 50 |

### 5. Product Adoption Models

#### Bass Diffusion Model
```
Adopters(t) = p √ó Remaining Market + q √ó (Cumulative Adopters / Market) √ó Remaining Market

Where:
p = Coefficient of innovation (external influence)
q = Coefficient of imitation (internal influence)
```

#### Rogers' Adoption Curve
- **Innovators**: 2.5%
- **Early Adopters**: 13.5%
- **Early Majority**: 34%
- **Late Majority**: 34%
- **Laggards**: 16%
