## Course Philosophy

Customers are the lifeblood of an organization, for without customers, a firm has no purpose, revenue, profit, or market value. To attract and retain customers and earn a sustainable profit from them, managers must specify and quantify market opportunities, anticipate and identify customer needs and wants, and satisfy them by delivering brands, products, and services that offer value that is different from and superior to the value offered by other firms in a competitive marketplace.
Marketing consists of the set of value-creating activities undertaken by an organization to initiate, nurture, grow, and secure profitable relationships with customers. In today's organizations, marketing is not merely a functional department, it is a way of thinking, a customer orientation, that permeates the entire organization and results in managers from many departments working collaboratively to create, communicate, and deliver value to customers.
The purpose of marketing is to create value for our chosen customers and to capture a fair share of that value for our stakeholders. Thus, customers are our assets, profitable and sustainable growth is our imperative, and marketing strategies are strategic investments designed to create two critical assets -- a brand (brand equity) and a customer portfolio (customer equity) -- that secure sales and profits, drive growth, and create defendable competitive advantage.
Marketing has the power to create value: value for customers, value for companies, and value for investors. Regardless of which role you will play, from creating and building value as an entrepreneur or operating manager, to assessing and investing in the value built by others as a private equity or venture capital investor, or to helping companies unlock their own value as a management consultant, understanding the science and art of marketing, and making smart marketing investment decisions will empower you to be a value creator.
