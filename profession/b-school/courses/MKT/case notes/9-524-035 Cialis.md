# Cialis: Brand Positioning and Customer Value Proposition

## Quick Facts
- **Case #**: 9-524-035
- **Course**: [[MKT]]
- **Date Read**: 2025-09-17
- **Industry**: Pharmaceutical
- **Geography**: United States

## Executive Summary
> Eli Lilly and ICOS face the critical decision of how to position Cialis in the erectile dysfunction (ED) market dominated by Viagra. With a 36-hour duration versus Viagra's 4-6 hours, Cialis must determine whether to compete head-on with functional superiority or redefine the market through emotional and relationship-based positioning.

- Patient satisfaction and retention
- Premium pricing sustainability

## Analysis

### Strengths
- 36-hour duration vs. 4-6 hours for Viagra ("weekend pill")
- Lower food interaction than Viagra
- Joint venture combines Lilly's marketing with ICOS's innovation
- Can be taken daily at lower doses
- Less planning required for intimacy

### Weaknesses
- Late market entry (5 years after Viagra)
- No proven superior efficacy
- Higher cost of goods
- Limited brand awareness
- Competing against established treatment patterns

### Opportunities
- Expand ED market through different positioning
- Target dissatisfied Viagra users (~30%)
- Position for younger, relationship-focused segments
- Create new usage occasions (weekend/vacation)
- Potential for daily therapy indication

### Threats
- Pfizer's marketing power and resources

|--------|-------|-------|
| Global ED Market | $1.9B | 2003 estimate |
| Viagra Sales | $1.7B | ~90% market share |
| Cialis EU Sales | $100M | First year in Europe |
| Target Share | 15-20% | 3-year goal |
| Price Premium | 10-15% | Versus Viagra |

## Key Exhibits
- Exhibit 1: Clinical trial efficacy comparison
- Exhibit 2: Duration of action profiles
- Exhibit 3: Patient satisfaction surveys
- Exhibit 4: Physician attitudes toward ED treatments
- Exhibit 5: Market segmentation analysis

## Discussion Questions
1. Should Cialis compete directly on functional benefits or emotional/relationship benefits?
2. How can Cialis differentiate without directly attacking Viagra?
3. What customer segments offer the best opportunity?
4. How should Cialis price relative to Viagra?
5. What role should the 36-hour duration play in positioning?

## My Analysis & Recommendations

### Option 1: Functional Superiority ("The Better Pill")
**Pros**:
- Clear product advantage (36-hour duration)
- Simple message for physicians
- Direct comparison favorable

**Cons**:
- Invites head-to-head battle with Pfizer
- Reduces to feature competition
- May trigger price competition

### Option 2: Emotional Positioning ("Rediscover Intimacy")
**Pros**:
- Differentiates from Viagra's functional focus
- Appeals to couples and relationships
- Expands market beyond current users

**Cons**:
- Harder to communicate to physicians
- Requires consumer education
- May not drive switching

### Option 3: New Segment Focus ("The Weekend Solution")
**Pros**:
- Creates new usage category
- Avoids direct competition
- Premium pricing justified

**Cons**:
- Smaller initial market
- Requires behavior change
- May limit frequency

### Recommended Action
> Position Cialis as the relationship-enhancing ED solution that restores spontaneity and intimacy through its unique 36-hour window, targeting couples who want to move beyond the mechanical nature of planned ED treatment.

### Implementation Plan
1. Launch with "Choose the Moment" campaign emphasizing spontaneity
2. Target couples through consumer education, not just patients
3. Price at 10% premium to signal superior value
4. Focus medical education on relationship quality metrics
5. Develop weekend/vacation packaging options
6. Build emotional brand equity before functional comparisons

## Class Discussion Notes

### My Participation
- **Times Spoken**: 0
- **Cold Called**: No

### Customer Value Proposition Framework
The class emphasized the systematic **Customer Value Proposition (CVP)** framework for competitive positioning:
- **For (target)**: Clear target definition essential
- **[Brand] is (claim)**: Differentiated positioning claim
- **Among all (competitive framing)**: Context for comparison
- **Because (reason to believe)**: Credible proof points

This framework demonstrates that effective positioning requires all four elements working together—you can't just have a great product feature without clear targeting and credible support.

### Competitive Strategy Dimensions
The discussion highlighted three fundamental ways to compete:
- **"The Who"**: Competing on target markets (segmentation strategy)
- **"The What"**: Competing on product features (differentiation strategy)
- **"The How"**: Competing on operational approaches (execution strategy)

Cialis faced the strategic choice of whether to compete on "what" (36-hour duration) or "who" (relationship-focused couples) or "how" (different distribution/education model).

### Differentiation Strategy Types
Critical distinction between two types of differentiation:
- **Vertical differentiation**: Direct comparison against competitors on existing attributes—"we're better at X"
- **Horizontal differentiation**: Extending competitive factors to broader benefits and "expanding the pie"—introducing new value dimensions

The insight that horizontal differentiation allows claiming the "moral high ground" by reframing the conversation rather than just competing on established metrics.

### Market Expansion Philosophy
The concept of **"expanding the pie"** versus fighting for market share represents sophisticated strategic thinking. Rather than accepting the ED market as defined by Viagra (functional, medical, episode-based), Cialis could redefine it as a relationship and lifestyle market. This creates new value categories rather than simply competing for the existing customer base.

### Professor's Takeaways
- Successful challengers often win by changing the rules, not playing by them
- Emotional positioning can be more defensible than functional claims
- Market creation can be more valuable than market share capture

## Personal Reflections & Key Takeaways

### Synthesis of Learning

#### The Power of Reframing Competition
The CVP framework combined with the horizontal differentiation strategy reveals that Cialis's best path wasn't to compete on Viagra's terms but to redefine what ED treatment could mean. By shifting from "treating a medical condition" to "enhancing relationships," Cialis could claim uncontested market space while expanding the category.

#### Multi-Dimensional Competitive Strategy
The "Who/What/How" framework demonstrates that focusing solely on product features (the 36-hour window) would trap Cialis in vertical differentiation against a dominant incumbent. The winning strategy required simultaneous innovation across targeting (couples vs. patients), positioning (spontaneity vs. performance), and execution (relationship education vs. medical detail).

#### Creating Versus Capturing Value
The distinction between expanding the pie and fighting for share has profound implications. Cialis's opportunity wasn't just to convert Viagra users but to bring new patients into treatment by removing the stigma and mechanical nature of ED treatment. This horizontal differentiation strategy could achieve premium pricing while avoiding direct price competition.

#### The Moral High Ground of Market Expansion
By positioning around relationships and spontaneity, Cialis could claim to be improving couples' quality of life rather than just treating dysfunction. This "moral high ground" positioning makes competitive response difficult—Pfizer couldn't easily abandon its medical/functional positioning without confusing its established user base.

### Applications to Future Situations
- When facing dominant competitors, look for opportunities to redefine the market rather than compete directly
- Emotional benefits can provide more sustainable differentiation than functional features
- The CVP framework ensures all elements of positioning work together coherently
- Horizontal differentiation often commands premium pricing better than vertical claims

### Questions for Further Research
- How did Cialis's actual market performance compare to positioning strategies discussed?
- What was Viagra's competitive response to Cialis's differentiated positioning?
- How did daily Cialis dosing change the market dynamics?
- What role did direct-to-consumer advertising play in market expansion?
- How did insurance coverage decisions affect the competitive dynamics?
