# Travelogo: Understanding Customer Journeys

## Quick Facts
- **Case #**: 9-524-044
- **Course**: [[MKT]]
- **Date Read**: 2025-09-09
- **Industry**: Online Travel Services
- **Geography**: Global

## Executive Summary
> Sarah Merino, new Manager of Customer Insights at Travelogo (online travel platform), must analyze clickstream data to identify customer personas and develop targeted marketing strategies. With a Friday deadline for recommendations to increase traffic and conversions, she needs to determine optimal segmentation variables and actionable insights for each customer segment.

## Case Context

### Company Background
- **Travelogo**: Online travel website enabling flight bookings worldwide
- Users can collect points from any airline
- Platform serves diverse customer base with varying travel needs
- Focus on understanding user behavior through digital footprints

### Industry Landscape
- Competitive online travel agency (OTA) market
- Data-driven decision making becoming critical differentiator
- Customer journey complexity increasing with multiple touchpoints
- Personalization expected by modern travelers

### Timeline of Events
- **May 22, 2023**: Sarah Merino completes first month as Manager, Customer Insights
- **Same day**: Mike Bower (Senior Director of Marketing) assigns segmentation task
- **By Friday (May 26)**: Report due for marketing team meeting
- **Following week**: Marketing team to decide on new product and promotion strategies

## Key Protagonists
- **Sarah Merino**: Manager, Customer Insights
  - Background: New to role (1 month)
  - Key decisions: Segmentation approach, variable selection, number of personas

- **Mike Bower**: Senior Director of Marketing
  - Background: Requesting actionable insights
  - Key decisions: Needs strategies to increase traffic and conversions

- **Data Analyst**: Team member
  - Background: Conducting technical analysis
  - Key decisions: K-means clustering implementation

## Central Problem/Decision

### The Question
> How should Travelogo segment its customers using clickstream data to develop targeted marketing strategies that will increase both traffic and conversions?

### Constraints
1. Limited time frame (report due by Friday)
2. Must use existing clickstream data only
3. Recommendations must be actionable for marketing team
4. Need to balance granularity with operational feasibility

### Success Metrics
- Increased platform traffic
- Higher conversion rates
- Better customer understanding
- Actionable marketing strategies per segment

## Analysis

### Strengths
- Rich clickstream data capturing comprehensive user behavior
- Multiple data dimensions (trip characteristics, session attributes, engagement)
- Real-time behavioral insights beyond demographics
- K-means clustering tool available for analysis

### Weaknesses
- New manager with limited institutional knowledge
- Time pressure for analysis and recommendations
- No demographic data available
- Family segment showing lowest conversion rates

### Opportunities
- Personalized marketing by segment
- Channel optimization based on personas
- Conversion funnel improvements
- Targeted acquisition strategies

### Threats
- Competitive OTA market
- Customer privacy concerns with data usage
- Risk of over-segmentation reducing actionability
- Missing segments if wrong variables selected

## Financial Analysis
| Metric | Globetrotters | Budget-Conscious | Family Vacationers | Business Travelers |
|--------|--------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Segment Size | ~20% | ~35% | ~25% | ~20% |
| Avg Trip Distance | International only | Domestic focus | Mixed | Mixed |
| Price Sensitivity | Low | High | High | Low |
| Conversion Rate | Moderate | Moderate | Lowest | Highest |
| Device Preference | Mixed | Mobile/App | Mobile | Desktop |

## Key Exhibits
- Exhibit 1: Table 1 - Variable descriptions for clickstream data
- Dashboard: "Travelogo: Customer Segmentation" (HBS No. 525-706)
- Visualization tool showing various segmentation result sets

## Discussion Questions
1. What are the main customer personas (or "archetypes") you see in the data?
2. Which variables would you include to create these customer personas? Why those?
3. How many segments do you find to provide the most useful and actionable solution?
4. Which specific promotional strategies do you recommend for each segment?

## My Analysis & Recommendations

### Option 1: Three-Segment Solution
**Pros**:
- Simpler to operationalize
- Clear distinctions between segments
- Easier to develop targeted strategies

**Cons**:
- May miss important nuances
- Business travelers potentially grouped with others
- Less precision in targeting

### Option 2: Four-Segment Solution
**Pros**:
- Captures distinct business traveler segment
- Better reflects actual user behavior
- More targeted marketing possible

**Cons**:
- More complex to manage
- Higher operational costs
- Risk of over-segmentation

### Recommended Action
> Implement four-segment solution with distinct personas: Globetrotters, Budget-Conscious Adults, Family Vacationers, and Business Travelers. Each requires tailored marketing approach based on unique characteristics and journey patterns.

### Implementation Plan
1. **Immediate (Week 1)**: Finalize segmentation and create persona profiles
2. **Short-term (Month 1)**: Develop segment-specific marketing campaigns
3. **Medium-term (Quarter 1)**: Launch targeted promotions and measure impact
4. **Long-term (Year 1)**: Refine segments based on performance data

## Class Discussion Notes

### My Participation
- **Times Spoken**: 2
- **Cold Called**: No

### Key Insights from Discussion
- Clickstream data reveals behavioral patterns invisible in traditional demographics
- Device type serves as proxy for use context (desktop = business context)
- Conversion rates vary significantly by segment, requiring different approaches
- Family segment needs simplified booking flow to improve conversion

### Alternative Perspectives
- Some argued for five segments to separate solo business from group business travel
- Discussion on whether international-only travelers warranted separate segment
- Debate on using purchase data vs. just search behavior for segmentation

### Professor's Takeaways
- "Behavioral segmentation trumps demographic segmentation in digital contexts"
- "The best segmentation balances statistical validity with business practicality"
- "Each segment should have a distinct marketing strategy, or it's not worth separating"
- "Focus on segments where you can win, not trying to be everything to everyone"

## Personal Reflections & Key Takeaways

### Synthesis of Learning
1. **Digital footprints as strategic assets**: Classroom discussion revealed how clickstream data provides richer insights than surveys or demographics, with professor emphasizing that "every click tells a story" - this transforms how we think about customer understanding from static profiles to dynamic journeys.

2. **Segmentation as strategy, not statistics**: The integration of professor's framework with case analysis showed that optimal clustering isn't about mathematical purity but business actionability - four segments balanced analytical rigor with operational feasibility.

3. **Device as context indicator**: Professor's insight that "device choice reveals intent" connected with the data showing business travelers' desktop preference - this principle extends beyond travel to any digital business where context drives behavior.

### Applications to Future Situations
- Use behavioral data to challenge assumptions about customer needs
- Test segmentation solutions against "so what?" criterion - can we act differently?
- Consider customer journey stage when analyzing conversion metrics
- Balance personalization benefits against operational complexity

### Questions for Further Research
- How do segments evolve as customers mature in their relationship with platform?
- What role does competitive activity play in segment behavior?
- Can machine learning improve real-time segment identification?
- How to measure ROI of segment-specific marketing investments?
