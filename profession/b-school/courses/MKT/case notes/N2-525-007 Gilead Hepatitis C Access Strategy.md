# Gilead: Hepatitis C Access Strategy (A) Abridged

## Quick Facts
- **Case #**: N2-525-007
- **Course**: [[MKT]]
- **Class #**: 7
- **Date Read**: 2025-10-05
- **Industry**: Pharmaceuticals / Biotechnology
- **Geography**: Global (U.S., Egypt, India, 130 low-income countries)

## Executive Summary
In December 2013, Gilead Sciences faces a critical pricing decision for Sovaldi, its breakthrough hepatitis C cure with 95% efficacy and minimal side effects. The U.S. price under consideration is $84,000 for a 12-week treatment ($1,000/pill), sparking controversy despite the drug's transformative benefits. Clifford Samuel, head of Gilead's Access Operations and Emerging Markets (AOEM) division, must determine pricing strategy for 130 low-income countries where 60% of the 185 million global HCV patients reside. The challenge: replicate Gilead's successful HIV/AIDS access model (reaching 6 million patients at $100-125/year through voluntary licensing) while navigating risks of parallel importation, payer backlash in developed markets, and maintaining Gilead's reputation. The case explores the "pricing thermometer" framework: value-in-use (top), competitor prices (middle), variable costs (bottom) define the zone of potential agreement—venture outside and you enter danger zones for producer or consumer.

## Case Context

### Company Background

**Gilead Sciences, Inc.:**
- **Founded**: 1987, headquartered Foster City, California
- **2013 Scale**: $11.2B revenue, $3.1B net income
- **Growth Driver**: HIV/AIDS antiretroviral (ARV) medications (80% of revenue/profits)
- **Product Portfolio**: 18 commercially available drugs, 30 in research pipeline
- **Therapeutic Areas**: HIV/AIDS, cardiovascular, respiratory, cancer, liver diseases
- **Strategy**: Acquire/license emerging technology rather than basic research (e.g., $11B Pharmasset acquisition for Sovaldi)

**Sovaldi (Sofosbuvir) - Direct-Acting Antiviral (DAA):**
- **FDA Approval**: December 2013 (U.S.)
- **European Approval**: January 2014
- **Efficacy**: 95% cure rate (vs. 45-70% for old standard of care)
- **Treatment**: 12-week course, well-tolerated, minimal side effects
- **Mechanism**: RNA polymerase inhibitor (blocks HCV replication)
- **Regimen**: Sovaldi + ribavirin + weekly peginterferon injection
- **Total Treatment Cost**: $84,000 Sovaldi + $10,000 (ribavirin/peginterferon) = $94,000

**HIV/AIDS Access Strategy (2001-2013 Success Story):**
- **Dual Channel Approach**:
  1. **Branded Distributors** (11 distributors): Two-tiered pricing, 15% margin, serve middle/upper-income consumers in developing countries
  2. **Voluntary Licensing** (15 generic manufacturers in India/South Africa): 5% royalty, transfer technology/know-how, allowed to sell in 95 low-income countries
- **Results**: 6 million patients (60% of need) accessing ARVs at $100-125/year
- **Market Share**: 80% in developed countries (1.6M patients), 60% in developing countries (6M patients)
- **Price Evolution**: First-gen ARVs dropped from $10,000/year (2001) → $100/year (2008) due to generics

### Industry Landscape

**Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Global Burden:**
- **Global Prevalence**: 185 million people (3 million U.S., 60% in AOEM footprint)
- **Annual Deaths**: 500,000 globally, 10,500 U.S.
- **Highest Prevalence Countries**:
  - China: 30 million (not in AOEM)
  - India: 20 million
  - Egypt: 15 million (15% prevalence rate - highest globally)
- **Genotypes**: 6 types, genotype 1 predominant in U.S./Europe/Japan, genotype 3 in India/Pakistan, genotype 4 in Egypt (90%)

**HCV Disease Progression:**
- **Initial Stage**: Relatively benign, many patients unaware
- **Chronic Stage**: Liver inflammation develops over 2-3 decades
- **Cirrhosis**: Liver damage, scar tissue, leading cause of liver transplantation
- **Liver Cancer**: Significantly increased risk, poor long-term prognosis
- **U.S. Demographics**: Highest prevalence in baby boomers (1946-1964), injection drug use primary transmission

**Previous Standard of Care (Pre-2013):**
- **Treatment**: Pegylated interferon (weekly injection) + ribavirin (oral)
- **Duration**: 24-48 weeks
- **Efficacy**: 70-80% SVR for genotypes 2/3, only 45-70% for genotype 1
- **Side Effects**: 80% adverse effects (flu-like symptoms, anemia, neutropenia, rash, depression)
- **Ineligibility**: 50% of patients ineligible due to coexisting conditions
- **Suppliers**: Merck (peginterferon), Roche (peginterferon)
- **Cost**: ~$25,000 for full treatment

**2011 DAA Breakthrough (First Generation):**
- **Drugs**: Boceprevir (Merck), Telaprevir (Vertex)
- **Efficacy**: 75% SVR (vs 44% old standard) in ADVANCE Trial
- **Mechanism**: Protease inhibitors (direct antiviral, not immune-based)
- **Revenue**: Vertex drug ~$2B first full year
- **Limitations**: Still required peginterferon + ribavirin (retained side effects), anemia, rash, genotype 1 only
- **Cost**: See Table A (ranged from $64K-106K depending on duration)

**2013 DAA Second Generation:**
- **Gilead Sovaldi**: 95% cure, well-tolerated, fewer drug interactions, superior to competitors
- **Janssen Olysio** (simeprevir): Lower efficacy, drug-drug interactions with HIV meds
- **AASLD Recommendation**: 12-week Sovaldi + ribavirin + weekly peginterferon

**Competitive Pricing (Table A - Existing Treatments):**
| Regimen | Cost | Duration |
|---------|------|----------|
| OLYSIO + PEGASYS + ribavirin | $106,673 | 48 weeks |
| INCIVEK + PEGASYS + ribavirin | $106,468 | 48 weeks |
| VICTRELIS + PEGINTRON + ribavirin | $95,845 | 48 weeks |
| OLYSIO + PEGASYS + ribavirin | $86,516 | 24 weeks |
| VICTRELIS + PEGINTRON + ribavirin | $64,825 | 28 weeks |

**U.S. Healthcare Economics:**
- **National Health Expenditure (2012)**: $3 trillion (GDP: $16T, population: 315M)
  - Hospital care: 32%
  - Physician/clinical: 20%
  - Prescription drugs: 10% ($300B)
- **Prescription Drug Payers**:
  - Private insurance: 45%
  - Medicare: 30%
  - Medicaid: 10%

**HCV Treatment Cost Burden (per patient):**
- **Non-cirrhotic stage**: $8,000/year × 10 years = $80,000
- **Compensated cirrhosis**: $13,000/year × 2 years = $26,000
- **End-stage liver disease**: $42,000/year × 2 years = $84,000
- **Total lifetime cost**: ~$190,000 over 14 years (vs $84,000 Sovaldi cure)

## Central Problem/Decision

### The Question
**How should Gilead price Sovaldi globally to balance access goals, revenue needs, and market dynamics?**

### Assignment Questions (from Canvas):

**Submit to poll before 8:00 AM on September 23rd:**

1. **Is $84,000 a fair price for U.S. customers? Why or why not?**

2. **What criteria should Gilead use for setting its price?**

3. **Who is the customer for this drug in the U.S.? How do they buy the drug? Which criteria determine whether Sovaldi is prescribed? Who is part of this decision and what do they care about?**

4. **If Gilead chooses to offer HCV drugs to Egypt and India, how should it price the drug in those countries? Why? How should the company adjust the remainder of its marketing mix to accommodate these prices?**

5. **Should Gilead follow the voluntary licensing distribution model for Sovaldi? Why or why not?**

### Pricing Challenges:

**U.S. Market:**
- **Proposed Price**: $84,000 per 12-week treatment ($1,000/pill)
- **Controversy**: "Extraordinarily expensive" despite breakthrough efficacy
- **Payer Concerns**: Private insurance (45%), Medicare (30%), Medicaid (10%)
- **California**: Considering not covering drug if "priced too high"

**Global Markets (AOEM - 130 Countries):**
- **Uniform Global Pricing Risk**: Patients in low-income countries can't afford → low penetration, critical backlash
- **Differential Pricing Risk**: Developed market insurers balk, parallel importation into higher-priced countries
- **Precedent**: Gilead's HIV/AIDS success created high expectations

**Key Trade-offs:**
1. **Access vs. Revenue**: AOEM mandate = access first, financially sustainable (profit if possible, not loss)
2. **Tiered Pricing**: Canada/Western Europe expect 20-30% discount off U.S. price
3. **Voluntary Licensing**: Transfer technology to generics (5% royalty) vs. maintain control
4. **Parallel Importation**: Low-priced drugs flowing back to high-priced markets
5. **Reputation Risk**: Gilead known for HIV/AIDS access, expectations high for HCV

### Constraints
- **R&D Economics**: $2.6B average cost per drug (including opportunity cost), $11B Pharmasset acquisition
- **Pharma Industry**: $60B/year R&D spend (~17% of sales), only 1 in 5,000 compounds commercialized, 20-25 new drugs/year, only 1-2 blockbusters
- **Patent Protection**: Gilead holds patents on Sovaldi, could license or enforce exclusivity
- **Payer Pushback**: Molina Healthcare considering not covering, California state resistance
- **Low-Income Countries**: Egypt (15M patients, 15% prevalence), India (20M patients) can't afford $84K
- **Generic Competition**: India/South Africa manufacturers ready to produce at lower cost if licensed
- **Parallel Importation**: Risk of low-priced drugs flowing back to U.S./Europe

### Success Metrics
- **Access**: Number of patients treated globally (target: high penetration in 185M global HCV population)
- **Revenue**: U.S. blockbuster status (>$1B first year), global revenue growth
- **Profit**: AOEM financially sustainable (not a loss), overall company profitability
- **Reputation**: Maintain HIV/AIDS access credibility, avoid backlash
- **Market Share**: Compete against existing DAAs, future competitors
- **Public Health**: Reduce 500,000 annual global HCV deaths

## Analysis

### SWOT Analysis

**Strengths:**
- **Superior Product**: 95% cure rate vs 45-70% old standard, minimal side effects
- **HIV/AIDS Access Credibility**: 6M patients reached at $100-125/year, voluntary licensing success
- **AOEM Organization**: Dedicated access division with clear mandate, dual-channel distribution model
- **Market Leadership**: 80% share in developed HIV/AIDS markets
- **Financial Strength**: $11.2B revenue, $3.1B net income (2013)
- **Generic Partnerships**: 15 licensed manufacturers in India/South Africa with proven track record

**Weaknesses:**
- **High U.S. Price**: $84,000 controversial, payer resistance
- **R&D Cost**: $11B Pharmasset acquisition needs recoupment
- **Generic License Precedent**: HIV/AIDS model created expectations for HCV
- **Limited Treatment History**: Sovaldi just approved, no long-term market data
- **AOEM Financial Constraint**: Must be sustainable (not a loss), limits pricing flexibility

**Opportunities:**
- **Massive Market**: 185M global HCV patients (3M U.S., 60% in AOEM footprint)
- **Value-in-Use**: Lifetime HCV treatment cost ~$190K vs $84K Sovaldi cure = $106K savings
- **Tiered Pricing**: Segment markets by ability to pay (U.S., Europe, emerging, low-income)
- **Voluntary Licensing**: Replicate HIV/AIDS success, expand access while maintaining royalties
- **Competitor Displacement**: Superior to existing DAAs ($64K-106K, lower efficacy, more side effects)
- **Public Health Impact**: Reduce 500,000 annual deaths, prevent liver transplants/cancer
- **Blockbuster Potential**: Large patient population, high efficacy, limited competition

**Threats:**
- **Payer Backlash**: Medicaid/Medicare/private insurers may refuse coverage
- **Parallel Importation**: Low-priced drugs from Egypt/India flowing to U.S./Europe
- **Generic Competition**: Without licensing, Indian generics may produce anyway (liberal patent laws)
- **Reputational Risk**: HIV/AIDS access success creates high HCV expectations
- **Political Risk**: Government price controls, compulsory licensing
- **Future Competition**: Other pharma companies developing HCV cures
- **Price Erosion**: Differential pricing in low-income countries may pressure U.S. prices

## Financial Analysis

### Pricing Thermometer Framework (from Class Discussion):

**Zone of Potential Agreement:**
1. **Value-in-Use (Top - Customer Ceiling)**:
   - Lifetime HCV treatment cost: ~$190,000 (10 yrs × $8K + 2 yrs × $13K + 2 yrs × $42K)
   - Sovaldi value: $84,000 treatment = $106,000 savings
   - **Economic Value to Customer (EVC)**: $190,000
   - **Consumer Surplus at $84K**: $106,000

2. **Competitor Prices (Middle - Reference Point)**:
   - Existing DAAs: $64,825 - $106,673 (24-48 weeks, lower efficacy, more side effects)
   - Old standard: $25,000 (peginterferon + ribavirin, 45-70% cure)
   - **Competitive Range**: $65K - $107K

3. **Variable Costs (Bottom - Producer Floor)**:
   - Manufacturing cost: Not disclosed (likely low for pills)
   - R&D sunk cost: $11B Pharmasset acquisition + Phase 3 trials
   - **Marginal Cost**: Minimal (pharmaceutical pills typically pennies to dollars)

**Danger Zones:**
- **Above Value-in-Use**: Customer won't buy (no economic benefit)
- **Below Variable Costs**: Producer loses money on each unit

**Gilead's $84,000 Price Analysis:**
- **Position**: At top of competitor range, well below value-in-use ($190K)
- **Consumer Surplus**: $106K (strong value proposition)
- **Contribution Margin**: Extremely high (low variable costs vs $84K price)
- **Rationale**: Capture value from superior efficacy (95% vs 45-70%), shorter duration (12 weeks vs 24-48), fewer side effects

### Global Tiered Pricing Economics:

**Developed Markets:**
| Market | Price | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| U.S. | $84,000 | Value-in-use, competitor prices, payer willingness |
| Canada/Europe | $58,800-67,200 | 20-30% discount off U.S. (universal healthcare negotiation) |

**Emerging Markets:**
- **Middle/Upper Income**: Branded distributors, 15% margin, tiered pricing
- **Low Income (Egypt, India)**: Voluntary licensing or deep discounts?

**HIV/AIDS Precedent:**
- Branded: $300/year in hard-hit countries
- Generics: $100-125/year through licensed manufacturers
- **Royalty**: 5% on generic sales

**Potential HCV Tiered Pricing:**
- **U.S.**: $84,000
- **Europe/Canada**: $60,000 (30% discount)
- **Middle-Income AOEM**: $5,000-10,000 (via distributors)
- **Low-Income AOEM**: $500-1,000 (via generic licensees with 5% royalty)

### Revenue Potential:

**U.S. Market:**
- 3 million HCV patients
- Assume 30% treated in first 5 years = 900,000 patients
- Revenue: 900,000 × $84,000 = $75.6B over 5 years

**Global Market (AOEM - 60% of 185M = 111M patients):**
- Assume 10% penetration over 5 years = 11.1M patients
- At $500-1,000/treatment = $5.6B - $11.1B (generic licensing with 5% royalty = $280M-555M)

## Personal Reflections & Key Takeaways

### Synthesis of Learning

**Pricing Thermometer Application:**
The framework provides a structured way to think about pricing boundaries. For Sovaldi:
- Value-in-use ($190K lifetime HCV cost) sets ceiling
- Competitor DAAs ($65K-107K) provide reference
- Variable costs (low for pills) set floor
- $84K sits in sweet spot: below value-in-use (customer surplus), well above costs (profit), at top of competitive range (premium justified by superiority)

**Complexity of Pharmaceutical Pricing:**
Multiple stakeholders with different incentives create tension:
- Patients: Want cure regardless of price (value-in-use)
- Insurers: Want low prices (cost containment)
- Doctors: Want best outcomes (clinical efficacy)
- Gilead: Want to recoup R&D, maximize profit
- Society: Want access, public health benefit
- Government: Want affordable healthcare

**Global Pricing Dilemma:**
Uniform pricing = access barrier in low-income countries
Differential pricing = parallel importation risk, developed market backlash
Voluntary licensing = access expansion but revenue sacrifice
