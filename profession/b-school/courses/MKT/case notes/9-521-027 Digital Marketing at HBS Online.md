### Timeline of Events

- **FY20 (July 2019 - June 2020)**: 60% enrollment growth, 40% revenue increase

## Central Problem/Decision

### The Question
How should Mohsen allocate the FY21 digital marketing budget ($8 million) across various digital channels (Exhibit 9) and course offerings (Exhibit 10)?

### Sub-Questions from Assignment
1. **Programmatic Display Paradox**: In FY20, Mohsen allocated only 3% of ad budget to programmatic display ads despite lowest acquisition cost (Exhibit 9a). Why?

2. **CORe Budget Allocation**: CORe accounted for ~31% of overall revenue but only 9% of total ad spend in FY20. Is Mohsen underspending on this course and overspending on others? Why or why not?

3. **Branded vs. Generic Ads**: What is the best way to decide spending allocation between branded and generic ads (Exhibit 10)?

4. **Customer Acquisition Optimization**: How can Mohsen improve enrollment/learner acquisition to reduce CAC and improve paid media effectiveness?

5. **Beyond Paid Media**: What opportunities exist beyond paid media to accelerate growth?

6. **Short-Form Content Investment**: Should HBS Online invest in short-form content and learning tracks?

7. **Strategic Concerns**: How to address brand dilution concerns and potential overlap with other HBS academic programs? How can HBS Online best fulfill the school's mission?

### Constraints
- Marginal cost of serving an additional learner is zero (assume)
- Brand equity and mission concerns (maintain HBS reputation)
- Resource allocation trade-offs across channels and courses
- Overlap concerns with traditional HBS programs

### Success Metrics
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC) by channel

## Discussion Questions

### From Assignment Context:
1. How should Mohsen allocate the FY21 digital marketing budget across various digital channels (Exhibit 9) and course offerings (Exhibit 10)? Consider the following as you decide on the budget allocation:
   - In FY20, Mohsen allocated only 3% of her ad budget to programmatic display ads even though they have the lowest acquisition cost (see Exhibit 9a). Why?

   - What is the best way to decide how much to spend on branded and generic ads (Ex 10)?
   - You may assume that the marginal cost of serving an additional learner is zero.

2. How can Mohsen improve the enrollment or learner acquisition process to reduce customer acquisition cost and improve the effectiveness of paid media?
