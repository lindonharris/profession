# Predicting the Diffusion of New Products

## Quick Facts
- **Case #**: N2-524-004
- **Course**: [[MKT]]
- **Date Read**: 2025-09-17
- **Industry**: Multiple Industries
- **Geography**: United States

## Executive Summary
> This case examines four innovative products at various stages of market introduction to understand the factors that accelerate or hinder product diffusion. The products include Shucks (B2B HPP lobster processing), Apex Ski Boots (B2C comfort ski boots), Bo's Fine Foods Sliced Ketchup (B2C condiment innovation), and John Deere's AI farming software (B2B SaaS). Each product represents different challenges in predicting demand and achieving market acceptance for new-to-the-world innovations.

## Case Context

### Opening Context
- Apple Vision Pro example: $3,499 mixed reality headset, 180,000 units sold in presale weekend
- Challenge of predicting demand for new-to-the-world products
- Historical failures: New Coke, Microsoft Zune, Quibi, Google Glass, Meta's Horizon Worlds
- Sales estimates often miss by orders of magnitude (10x, 20x, or even 100x)

### Industry Landscape
The case covers four distinct industries:
1. **Lobster Processing** - $389M Maine industry, commodity business
2. **Ski Equipment** - 15M US skiers, concentrated retail distribution
3. **Condiments** - $30B market, dominated by Kraft Heinz (70% ketchup share)
4. **Agricultural Technology** - 2.5M units globally, Deere has 25% market share

### Timeline of Events
- **Shucks**: HPP technology applied to lobster processing
- **Apex**: Revolutionary two-part ski boot system introduced
- **Bo's**: Kickstarter campaign for sliced ketchup raised $30,090
- **John Deere**: Decades of investment in autonomous farming, launching AI SaaS

## Key Protagonists

### Shucks - John Hathaway
- **Background**: Owned Sea Star Grill lobster shack in Maine
- **Key decisions**: Enter lobster processing business with HPP technology

### Apex Ski Boots
- **Background**: Founders solving foot pain issue in ski boots
- **Key decisions**: How to overcome retail resistance and high price point

### Bo's Fine Foods - Emily Williams
- **Background**: Restaurateur's daughter, developed family recipes

## Central Problem/Decision

### The Question
> How can managers predict which innovative products will diffuse rapidly and broadly, and what changes to products and marketing strategies can accelerate adoption?

### Constraints
1. Limited historical data for new-to-world products
2. Customer education requirements
3. Existing behavioral patterns and preferences
4. Channel resistance and distribution challenges
5. Price sensitivity and value perception
6. Technology adoption barriers

- Premium pricing justified by quality
- Chef influencers can drive adoption
- Solves operational pain points

#### 3. Apex Ski Boots
**Rationale**:
- Strong solution to real pain point
- But faces significant channel resistance
- High price creates adoption barrier
- Cultural resistance ("pain = performance")

#### 4. Bo's Sliced Ketchup (Slowest)
**Rationale**:
- Solving problem consumers don't perceive
- High price for marginal benefit
- Strong incumbent (Heinz)
- Limited use occasions

## Personal Reflections & Key Takeaways

### Synthesis of Learning
1. **Diffusion speed depends on problem clarity**: Products solving obvious, painful problems (Deere's labor savings, Shucks' efficiency) diffuse faster than those addressing latent needs (Bo's mess prevention).

2. **B2B diffuses faster than B2C for innovations**: Rational ROI calculations in B2B accelerate adoption, while B2C faces emotional and habitual barriers that slow diffusion.

3. **Channel strategy can make or break diffusion**: Apex's struggle shows that even superior products fail when channels resist - direct-to-consumer or alternative channels may be necessary for truly innovative products.

4. **Price must align with perceived value**: Premium pricing works only when value is immediately apparent (Deere's ROI) or emotionally compelling (Apex's pain relief).

5. **Network effects accelerate adoption**: Products that improve with more users (Deere's AI) or create social proof (visible ski boots) diffuse more rapidly than standalone innovations.

### Applications to Future Situations
- Assess whether innovation solves recognized vs latent problem
- Consider B2B markets for radical innovations requiring education
- Plan for channel resistance with alternative go-to-market strategies
- Build in network effects or community elements where possible
- Focus on quantifiable benefits for premium-priced innovations

### Questions for Further Research
- How do cultural differences affect diffusion patterns globally?
- What role does social media play in accelerating/hindering diffusion?
- Can subscription models work in traditionally transactional industries?
- How do sustainability concerns influence adoption of new products?
