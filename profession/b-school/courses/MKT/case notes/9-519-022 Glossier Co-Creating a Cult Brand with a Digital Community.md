# Glossier: Co-Creating a Cult Brand with a Digital Community

## Quick Facts
- **Case #**: 9-519-022
- **Course**: [[MKT]]
- **Class #**: 10
- **Date Read**: 2025-10-06
- **Industry**: Beauty and Personal Care
- **Geography**: United States (NYC-based, digitally native)

## Executive Summary
In mid-2018, Glossier's leadership team debates how to deploy $52 million in Series C funding to scale their community-driven, DTC beauty brand. Having grown 600% in 2017 through organic, community-fueled marketing ("born from content, fueled by community"), they must decide which paid media programs and physical distribution strategies to pursue without alienating the passionate digital community that built the brand.

## Case Context

### Company Background
- Founded 2014 by Emily Weiss (age 29), launched from her beauty blog "Into The Gloss" (started 2010)
- Emerged from 1.5 million blog readers who provided product insights and became brand advocates
- Mission: Create "first socially driven beauty brand" that co-creates with community
- Strategy: "Born from content, fueled by community" - merchandising people's opinions alongside products
- By 2018: 26 SKU curated line ($12-60 price range), launching new products every 6 weeks
- Funding: $86M raised through multiple rounds (2014: $2M seed from Forerunner Ventures; Feb 2018: $52M Series C)
- Growth: 600% sales increase in 2017, customer community grew 3x in 2017
- Marketing approach: 80% sales from owned/earned media (Into The Gloss, Instagram), minimal paid advertising

### Industry Landscape
- Global beauty industry: $433B (2018), projected $750B by 2024
- Dominated by 8 major corporations, but smaller brands gaining share from "stodgy, slow, offline competitors"
- 80%+ purchases still through physical retailers, but DTC digital brands gaining traction
- Consumer behavior shift: Millennials fickle, swayed by peer influence vs. department store loyalty
- Discovery channels: YouTube tutorials, Instagram influencers replacing magazine racks
- Trend: Natural skin, "no makeup" look (5M+ Google results), vs. covering up with cosmetics
- All brands leveraging social media/influencer marketing; big brands launching incubators, acquiring startups

### Timeline of Events
- 2010: Emily Weiss launches "Into The Gloss" beauty blog at age 25
- 2014: Glossier launches with 4 products, $2M seed funding from Forerunner Ventures
- 2015: Emily named to Forbes "30 Under 30" list
- Mid-2016: 60,000 people on product waiting lists
- 2017: 600% sales growth, customer community grows 3x, 50,000+ Instagram tags (@Glossier), 17M+ reach
- Feb 2018: Closes oversubscribed $52M Series C round
- Mid-2018: Decision point on deploying capital for scaling

## Key Protagonists
- **Emily Weiss**: Founder & CEO
  - Former art student, styling assistant at W and Vogue magazines
  - Age 29 when featured on Forbes "30 Under 30" (2015)
  - Vision: "First beauty lifestyle brand," democratizing beauty, "brand as peer not authority"
  - Key decisions: Product development process, paid media programs, distribution expansion

- **Alexandra Weiss** (HBS '15): SVP of Marketing (no relation to Emily)
  - Key decisions: Marketing strategy for scaling, balancing authenticity with growth

- **Henry Davis**: President & CFO
  - Key decisions: Capital deployment, maintaining community engagement at scale

## Central Problem/Decision

### The Question
How should Glossier deploy its $52M Series C funding to scale beyond organic growth while preserving the authentic community relationships that built the brand?

**Specific decisions:**
1. **Paid Media Programs**: Which to pursue among:
   - Peer-to-peer sales representatives (converting evangelistic customers to paid reps)
   - Influencer marketing (engaging professional influencers)
   - Paid media (traditional advertising)
   - Customer loyalty program
2. **Distribution Strategy**: Should Glossier:
   - Open more showrooms?
   - Do more pop-ups?
   - Begin selling wholesale?
   - Double down on social commerce technology investments?

### Constraints
1. Maintaining authenticity as "brand as peer" (not "brand as authority")
2. Preserving community engagement and co-creation model at scale
3. Keeping up with hundreds of thousands of weekly customer comments
4. Community growing more heterogeneous beyond bicoastal millennials
5. 6-week product release cycle requires continuous innovation
6. Balancing community input vs. editorial control in R&D
7. Risk of alienating core community with commercialization

### Success Metrics
- Community engagement and loyalty (Instagram tags, reach, participation)
- Sales growth and customer acquisition cost
- Brand loyalty vs. product loyalty
- Diversity of customer base beyond early adopters
- Authenticity perception (maintaining "friend" relationship)
- Product sell-through and waiting list size

## Analysis

### Strengths
- **Community foundation**: 1.5M Into The Gloss readers, 200K Instagram followers, 60K Facebook fans
- **Organic growth engine**: 80% sales from owned/earned media, 60% women cite peer recommendations
- **Product-market fit**: Products sell out within days/weeks, 60K on waiting lists (mid-2016)
- **Social media mastery**: 50K+ Instagram tags in H2 2017, 17M+ reach, #glossierpink phenomenon
- **Brand loyalty**: "Cult" status, customers act like fan girls, sweatshirt/merchandise demand
- **Authentic voice**: "Would you talk to your friends that way?" copywriting guidelines
- **Co-creation model**: Community-inspired R&D, Slack groups with top 100 customers, pizza/ros√© events
- **Distinctive assets**: Pink bubble wrap pouches (like Apple AirPods), minimalist Instagram-friendly packaging
- **Customer experience**: CX team focused on engagement not cost reduction, personal responses from Emily
- **Demographics**: 60%+ customers age 18-35, 72% millennials, diverse representation

### Weaknesses
- **Limited scale**: Small company trying to maintain nimbleness as it grows
- **R&D speed**: Full year from community input to product launch (vs. ColourPop fast-fashion model)
- **Inventory management**: Frequent sell-outs frustrate customers despite generating buzz
- **Listening capacity**: Cannot keep up with hundreds of thousands of weekly comments
- **Heterogeneous community**: Harder to serve as customer base diversifies beyond early adopters
- **No physical presence**: Primarily DTC e-commerce, limited showrooms/pop-ups
- **Minimal paid media**: Heavy reliance on organic may limit scalability
- **Product vs. brand loyalty**: Risk of being seen as commodity (customers love products, not brand)

### Opportunities
- **$52M runway**: Significant capital to invest in growth initiatives
- **Market disruption**: Big brands losing share to smaller brands, traditional retail declining
- **Social commerce**: Instagram replacing magazines as discovery platform
- **Influencer marketing**: Peer influence drives 60% of beauty purchases
- **Physical retail**: Potential to complement digital with experiential showrooms/pop-ups
- **Brand loyalty**: Shift from product loyalty to "beauty lifestyle brand" (selling sweatshirts, totes)
- **Full line expansion**: Customers buying multiple SKUs, potential for holistic routines
- **Professional R&D**: Investment in scientists/lab could accelerate innovation
- **Loyalty program**: Formalize engagement with most passionate customers

### Threats
- **Loss of authenticity**: Paid programs (sales reps, influencers, ads) may feel inauthentic
- **Community backlash**: Commercialization could alienate core advocates
- **Wholesale dilution**: Selling through third parties contradicts DTC brand promise
- **Influencer fatigue**: Customers may see through paid influencer posts
- **Scale challenges**: Maintaining "brand as peer" at hundreds of thousands of customers
- **Big brand competition**: Established players launching incubators, acquiring startups, investing in R&D
- **Editorial control tension**: Listening to everyone vs. trusting brand vision
- **Customer heterogeneity**: Bicoastal millennials vs. broader market have different needs

## Discussion Questions

### Q1: Which factors have contributed to Glossier's early growth?

**Answer:**

**1. Community-Driven Product Development**
- 1.5M Into The Gloss readers provided real-time market research (free R&D)
- Products co-created with community input (e.g., Milky Jelly cleanser developed from 400 comments)
- Community feels ownership ‚Üí organic advocacy

**2. Owned & Earned Media Flywheel**
- Into The Gloss blog (1.5M readers, 10M monthly pageviews, $5M ad revenue) ‚Üí product discovery
- Instagram-first brand (50K+ tags, 17M reach in H2 2017) ‚Üí social proof
- 80% of sales from owned/earned media (minimal paid spend)

**3. Authentic "Brand as Peer" Positioning**
- Conversational copywriting ("Would you talk to your friends that way?")
- Emily personally responds to comments ‚Üí feels like friendship not corporation
- Anti-authority stance ("We are not an authority. Our voice is no more important than anyone else's")

**4. Social Commerce Design**
- Products designed for Instagram (minimalist packaging, #glossierpink)
- Pink bubble wrap pouches = portable brand billboard (like Apple AirPods)
- Stickers, merchandise create lifestyle brand beyond products

**5. Viral Customer Advocacy**
- Customers acting as unpaid brand ambassadors (60% of beauty purchases driven by peer recs)
- "Each customer has a microphone reaching 50, 500, 5K, or 500K friends"
- Cult status ‚Üí fan girl behavior ‚Üí waiting lists ‚Üí scarcity buzz

**6. Millennial-First Positioning**
- Natural skin/"no makeup" trend (5M+ Google results)
- Democratized beauty (vs. big brands telling women what's beautiful)
- Diverse representation (not professional models, real Glossier customers)

**7. Product-Market Fit**
- Edited 26 SKU line ($12-60) vs. overwhelming 1,000 SKU assortments
- Premium vs. mass, but accessible vs. department store luxury
- Products sell out within days/weeks ‚Üí validated demand

**Unit Economics Supporting Growth:**
- Blended CAC ‚âà $15.75 (30% paid at $52.50, 70% organic at ~$0)
- CLV/CAC ratio ‚âà 3.62 (healthy vs. 3.0 benchmark)
- Organic growth sustainable without VC-fueled paid media burn

---

### Q2: How should Glossier best deploy the $52 million infusion of capital it has just received from its Series C fundraise?

**Answer:**

**Recommended Allocation:**

**1. Social Commerce Platform ($30M - 58%)**
- Build technology to "merchandise people's opinions alongside products"
- Enable customers to share routines, tag products, purchase from peer content
- Creates self-contained demand-side value chain (vertically integrated on customer side)
- **Rationale**: This IS Glossier's unique competitive advantage that big brands cannot replicate. Emily's vision: "We're striving not for breadth of assortment like Amazon, but for breadth of human connections"

**2. Customer Loyalty Program ($5M - 10%)**
- Reward community participation (reviews, photos, referrals) NOT just purchases
- Early access to new products, exclusive events, local chapter meet-ups
- **Rationale**: Formalizes existing advocacy, improves retention (currently "completely organic"), ROI-positive if increases from 2 to 3 orders/year

**3. Pop-Up Experiential Retail ($10M - 19%)**
- 5-10 temporary installations in new markets (not NYC/LA bicoastal)
- Selfie stations, product testing, community meet-ups
- Data collection to inform permanent showroom decisions
- **Rationale**: Provides physical brand experiences without wholesale compromise, serves community desire for IRL connection

**4. R&D Lab Investment ($7M - 13%)**
- Hire scientists to accelerate 6-week product release cycle
- Better forecasting to reduce sell-outs (60K on waiting lists frustrates customers)
- Balance community input with editorial vision at scale
- **Rationale**: Can't keep up with 100Ks of weekly comments, need systems to maintain quality while scaling

**What NOT to Do:**
- ‚ùå **Paid media expansion** - CAC of $52.50 on $57 AOV = 1.08 ratio (barely profitable)
- ‚ùå **Wholesale (Sephora)** - Would "10x revenue overnight" but give up 40-50% margin, requires 18+ orders vs. 7 to break even
- ‚ùå **Peer-to-peer sales reps** - Commercializes authentic advocacy, risks pyramid scheme perception
- ‚ùå **Influencer marketing** - Contradicts democratized beauty message, millennials see through paid posts

**Strategic Philosophy:**
Per Henry Davis: "We don't want to take lots of VC money to put more fuel on the customer acquisition fire. We want to build a forever brand, not a fast-growing rocket ship... Anyone can buy customers, not everyone can earn them."

---

### Q3: Which of the four paid media programs should Glossier pursue? Why? How might each change relationships with customers and brand community?

**Answer:**

**Recommendation: Customer Loyalty Program ONLY**

**Detailed Assessment:**

#### **‚úÖ Customer Loyalty Program - PURSUE**

**Why:**
- Formalizes behavior already happening organically (reviews, referrals, social posts)
- Rewards participation, not just transactions ‚Üí maintains community ethos
- ROI-positive: Increasing retention from 2 to 3 orders/year lifts CLV from $136 to $288
- Sephora's Beauty Insider proves model works in beauty (birthday gifts, classes, events)

**Impact on Relationships:**
- ‚úÖ **Positive**: Deepens engagement with most passionate customers
- ‚úÖ **Positive**: Creates structure for local community chapters (pizza/ros√© at scale)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk**: Creating tiers may contradict "inclusive" values
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk**: Points commoditize relationship (transactional vs. belonging)

**Mitigation**: Focus rewards on experiences (early access, events, community recognition) NOT discounts/points

---

#### **‚ùå Peer-to-Peer Sales Representatives - AVOID**

**Why NOT:**
- Erodes authentic advocacy ‚Üí feels transactional ("Am I your friend or your sales target?")
- Pyramid scheme perception damages brand equity
- Difficult to manage quality/consistency across thousands of reps
- Customers already evangelizing for free (50K+ Instagram tags)

**Impact on Relationships:**
- ‚ùå **Negative**: Destroys "brand as peer" positioning (now you're my employer)
- ‚ùå **Negative**: Commercializes passion ‚Üí resentment ("You're monetizing my love for your brand?")
- ‚ùå **Negative**: Creates hierarchy (paid reps vs. organic fans)

**Quote from case**: Customers feel brand is "a close friend‚Äîa friend who was maybe a little older, maybe a little cooler... but never lost her sense of humor or humility." Paying them breaks this.

---

#### **‚ùå Influencer Marketing - AVOID**

**Why NOT:**
- Contradicts "democratized beauty" message (influencers become new authorities)
- Millennials savvy about #ad and #sponsored posts ‚Üí feels inauthentic
- Expensive relative to organic channels (CPM $40-50 for print/outdoor)
- Peer recommendations (60% of purchases) already happening organically

**Impact on Relationships:**
- ‚ùå **Negative**: Signals shift from community-first to sales-first
- ‚ùå **Negative**: Creates "haves" (paid influencers) vs. "have-nots" (organic community)
- ‚ùå **Negative**: Dilutes "everyone can be their own expert" philosophy

**Unit Economics**: Better to invest in social commerce platform that enables ALL customers to be micro-influencers vs. paying select few.

---

#### **‚ùå Paid Media (Traditional Advertising) - AVOID**

**Why NOT:**
- CAC of $52.50 on $57 AOV = 1.08 CLV/CAC ratio (barely profitable on first order)
- Contradicts "marketing without marketing" heritage
- Requires 7-9 touchpoints to convert ‚Üí expensive customer journey
- Diminishing returns as online media environment heats up (more competition, higher CPMs)

**Impact on Relationships:**
- ‚ùå **Negative**: Feels like "selling out" after years of organic growth
- ‚ùå **Negative**: One-way broadcast vs. two-way conversation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Neutral**: May not damage relationships IF done tastefully, but poor ROI

**Quote from Alexandra Weiss**: "One thing that made companies before us successful is that advertising came cheap... Now we have a lot more competition."

**Quote from Henry Davis**: "We're not trading on a growth multiple, we're trading on the fact that we've captured the imagination of a customer."

---

**Summary Matrix:**

| Program | Pursue? | CLV Impact | Community Impact | Authenticity Risk |
|---------|---------|------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Loyalty Program | ‚úÖ YES | +111% (2‚Üí3 orders) | Deepens engagement | LOW (if experience-based) |
| P2P Sales Reps | ‚ùå NO | Unknown | Erodes trust | HIGH (commercializes passion) |
| Influencer Marketing | ‚ùå NO | Marginal | Creates hierarchy | HIGH (new authorities) |
| Paid Media | ‚ùå NO | Minimal (1.08 ratio) | No impact | MEDIUM (signals shift) |

---

### Q4: Assess Glossier's distribution strategy options. Should the company open more showrooms? Should it do more pop-ups? Should it begin selling wholesale? Should it double down on social commerce technology investments? Why or why not? How might each of these decisions affect its relationships with its customers and its brand community?

**Answer:**

**Recommendation: Social Commerce (Primary) + Pop-Ups (Secondary)**

---

#### **‚úÖ DOUBLE DOWN - Social Commerce Technology Investments**

**Why PURSUE:**
- Aligns with Emily's core vision: "Merchandising people's opinions and stories just as much as products"
- Enables scalable peer-to-peer commerce (currently 20% of sales, all manual)
- Breaks "glass ceiling for DTC brands" without leaving ecosystem
- Creates defensible moat (technology + community network effects)
- Peer-to-peer CAC ‚âà $0 vs. paid media CAC $52.50

**How It Works:**
- Customers share beauty routines with product tags (shoppable content)
- Purchase directly from peer content (not brand marketing)
- "Breadth of human connections" vs. "breadth of assortment"
- Think Instagram Shopping meets Into The Gloss Top Shelf

**Impact on Community:**
- ‚úÖ **Highly Positive**: Empowers ALL customers to be influencers (not just select few)
- ‚úÖ **Highly Positive**: Monetizes existing behavior (already sharing #itgtopshelfie)
- ‚úÖ **Highly Positive**: Maintains "brand as peer" (customers selling to each other, not brand selling to customers)
- ‚úÖ **Highly Positive**: Scalable without sacrificing authenticity

**Unit Economics:**
- Enables 20% of customers (peer-to-peer) to grow to 50%+ at near-zero CAC
- If doubles peer-to-peer from 20% ‚Üí 40%, saves $52.50 √ó 20% of new customers
- Technology investment < marginal CAC savings at scale

**Quote**: "How can we break past this inflection point without leaving our own ecosystem?" - Social commerce is the answer.

---

#### **‚úÖ PURSUE SELECTIVELY - More Pop-Ups**

**Why PURSUE:**
- Provides experiential brand immersion without wholesale compromise
- Tests new markets beyond bicoastal (community growing heterogeneous)
- Creates Instagram moments (#glossierpink IRL)
- Temporary = maintains exclusivity, no permanent overhead
- Community desires IRL connection (pizza/ros√© events prove this)

**How to Execute:**
- 5-10 temporary installations in new cities (not just NYC/LA)
- Focus on experience (selfie stations, product testing, meet-ups) not sales
- Limited-time events (drops, launches, community gatherings)
- Data collection to inform potential permanent showroom locations

**Impact on Community:**
- ‚úÖ **Positive**: Serves local communities, inclusivity beyond digital natives
- ‚úÖ **Positive**: Creates shareable moments (extend #glossierpink to physical)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk**: Geographic exclusivity (why NYC gets pop-up but not Omaha?)

**Unit Economics:**
- Low fixed cost (temporary leases)
- Marketing expense, not revenue driver
- ROI = brand awareness + customer data + Instagram content

---

#### **‚ö†Ô∏è MAYBE - More Permanent Showrooms**

**Why CAUTIOUS:**
- High fixed costs (rent, staff, inventory) limit scalability
- Only serves local markets (doesn't solve DTC glass ceiling)
- May cannibalize DTC sales without incremental growth
- Requires significant operational expertise (retail different from e-commerce)

**When It Makes Sense:**
- AFTER pop-ups prove market demand in specific cities
- AFTER social commerce platform built (showrooms complement, not replace)
- IF designed as community hubs (events, meet-ups) not just retail

**Impact on Community:**
- ‚úÖ **Positive IF**: Showrooms are experiential gathering spaces
- ‚ùå **Negative IF**: Showrooms are transactional retail (dilutes digital-native DNA)

**Recommendation**: Wait. Focus on social commerce + pop-ups first. Revisit in 2019-2020 based on data.

---

#### **‚ùå AVOID - Wholesale (Sephora, Department Stores)**

**Why AVOID:**
- Gives up 40-50% margin ‚Üí requires 2.6x more orders to break even
- Loses direct customer relationship (can't collect data, emails, feedback)
- Brand dilution (sits next to 300 other brands, loses distinctiveness)
- Contradicts DTC brand promise and 4-year heritage
- Cannot control merchandising, storytelling, customer experience

**The Sephora Trap:**
Per Jessica White: "We would 10-fold our revenue, like overnight, but we'd have to give away massive amounts of margin, potentially 40-50%."

**Unit Economics:**
```
DTC: $57 AOV √ó 40% margin = $22.80 contribution
Wholesale: $57 AOV √ó 5% margin = $2.85 contribution

To recover $52.50 CAC:
DTC requires: 2.3 orders
Wholesale requires: 18.4 orders
```

**Impact on Community:**
- ‚ùå **Highly Negative**: Destroys "born from content, fueled by community" narrative
- ‚ùå **Highly Negative**: Customers discover products from Sephora shelves, not peers
- ‚ùå **Highly Negative**: Becomes "just another beauty brand" among 300 others
- ‚ùå **Highly Negative**: Cannot co-create (no feedback loop from wholesale customers)

**Quote from Emily**: "All the other DTC brands who only sell via e-commerce tend to cap out... they do a partnership with Target. But I don't necessarily believe that has to be true. How can we break past this inflection point without leaving our own ecosystem?"

**The Supreme Parallel**: Like Supreme avoiding wholesale to maintain exclusivity, Glossier's community moat REQUIRES direct relationship.

---

**Distribution Strategy Matrix:**

| Option | Priority | Investment | Community Impact | Unit Economics | Strategic Fit |
|--------|----------|------------|------------------|----------------|---------------|
| Social Commerce | ü•á PRIMARY | $30M | ‚úÖ Empowers all customers | Best (near-$0 CAC) | ‚úÖ Core vision |
| Pop-Ups | ü•à SECONDARY | $10M | ‚úÖ Local engagement | Neutral (marketing expense) | ‚úÖ Tests markets |
| Showrooms | ü•â TERTIARY | $0 (wait) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Depends on execution | Poor (high fixed costs) | ‚ö†Ô∏è After social commerce |
| Wholesale | ‚ùå REJECT | $0 | ‚ùå Destroys community moat | Terrible (18x orders needed) | ‚ùå Contradicts DNA |

---

**Final Recommendation:**

Invest 75% of capital ($30M) in social commerce platform to enable "vertically integrated demand-side value chain." This is Glossier's only path to break the DTC glass ceiling without selling out to wholesale or burning capital on paid media. The remaining 25% supports pop-ups ($10M) for physical experimentation and R&D ($7M) for product innovation.

**Quote that Sums It Up:**
"We think that's a paradigm of e-commerce that doesn't need to exist. How can we break past this inflection point without leaving our own ecosystem?" - Emily Weiss

Social commerce is the answer.

## My Analysis & Recommendations

### Option 1: Peer-to-Peer Sales Representatives
**Pros**:
- Leverages existing evangelism (customers already advocating unpaid)
- Maintains personal, friend-to-friend recommendation authenticity
- Scalable word-of-mouth (50, 500, 5K, or 500K followers per customer)
- Aligns with "brand as peer" positioning

**Cons**:
- May feel transactional, erode authentic advocacy
- Difficult to manage quality/consistency across thousands of reps
- Risk of pyramid scheme perception
- Customers may resent commercialization of their passion

### Option 2: Influencer Marketing
**Pros**:
- Proven channel (60% of beauty purchases driven by peer influence)
- Scalable reach through established audiences
- Can target specific demographics/psychographics
- Industry standard practice

**Cons**:
- Feels inauthentic vs. organic community endorsements
- Millennials savvy about paid influencer posts
- Dilutes "democratized beauty" message (influencers as new authorities)
- Expensive, may not deliver better ROI than owned/earned

### Option 3: Paid Media (Traditional Advertising)
**Pros**:
- Scalable customer acquisition
- Broader reach beyond existing community
- Control over messaging and timing

**Cons**:
- Contradicts "marketing without marketing" heritage
- Less credible than peer recommendations
- High cost relative to organic channels
- May signal shift from community-first to sales-first

### Option 4: Customer Loyalty Program
**Pros**:
- Formalizes engagement with most passionate customers
- Rewards advocacy behavior already happening organically
- Data insights into top customer behaviors
- Maintains community focus while incentivizing purchases

**Cons**:
- May commoditize relationship (points vs. belonging)
- Creates tiers that contradict "inclusive" values
- Administrative complexity
- Expects what customers already give freely

### Distribution Strategy Assessment

**More Showrooms**:
- Pros: Experiential brand immersion, Instagram moments, serves local communities, maintains DTC control
- Cons: High fixed costs, limited scalability, geographic constraints

**More Pop-Ups**:
- Pros: Flexible, event-driven buzz, tests markets, maintains exclusivity
- Cons: Temporary, operationally complex, limited revenue impact

**Wholesale**:
- Pros: Massive distribution scale, reduced customer acquisition cost, category legitimacy
- Cons: Contradicts DTC brand promise, loses customer relationship, margin pressure, brand dilution

**Social Commerce Technology**:
- Pros: Aligns with digital-native DNA, enables peer merchandising vision, scalable, leverages community
- Cons: Unproven technology, high development costs, competitive tech landscape

### Recommended Action
**Primary Focus**: Double down on social commerce technology + customer loyalty program
**Secondary**: Selective pop-ups in new markets, avoid wholesale

**Rationale**:
1. **Social commerce** delivers on Emily's vision of "merchandising people's opinions alongside products" - this is Glossier's unique competitive advantage that big brands cannot replicate
2. **Loyalty program** formalizes existing advocacy while maintaining community authenticity (reward participation, not just purchases)
3. **Pop-ups** provide physical brand experiences without wholesale compromise
4. **Avoid** peer-to-peer sales reps (too transactional), influencer marketing (inauthentic), paid media (inefficient), and wholesale (brand dilution)

### Implementation Plan
1. **Q3 2018**: Invest $30M in social commerce platform development
   - Enable customers to share routines, tag products, purchase from peer content
   - Build "breadth of human connections" into shopping experience
   - Integrate Into The Gloss content with e-commerce

2. **Q4 2018**: Launch tiered loyalty program ($5M)
   - Reward community participation (reviews, photos, referrals) not just purchases
   - Early access to new products for engaged members
   - Exclusive events (pizza/ros√© at scale via local chapters)

3. **2019**: Test market pop-ups ($10M)
   - 5-10 temporary installations in new cities
   - Experiential focus (selfie stations, product testing, community meet-ups)
   - Data collection to inform potential permanent showroom locations

4. **Ongoing**: Invest in R&D lab ($7M)
   - Hire scientists to accelerate 6-week release cycle
   - Balance community input with editorial vision
   - Reduce sell-outs through better forecasting

## Class Discussion Notes

### My Participation
- **Times Spoken**: 0
- **Cold Called**: No

### Key Insights from Discussion

**Three Types of Media (Marketing Framework):**

1. **Owned Media**
   - Content/channels you control directly
   - Examples: Into The Gloss blog, Glossier.com, email lists, branded social accounts
   - HubSpot's inbound blogging strategy as parallel example
   - Build once, compound returns over time
   - Foundation for earning trust and creating community

2. **Earned Media**
   - Organic coverage/sharing without payment
   - Examples: Going viral, product reviews, press coverage, customer social posts (#glossierpink)
   - 50K+ Instagram tags in H2 2017 = earned reach of 17M+
   - Most valuable because third-party credibility
   - Cannot be bought, must be earned through quality/community

3. **Paid Media**
   - Traditional advertising you pay for
   - Examples: Instagram ads, Google search, influencer partnerships, print/outdoor
   - Glossier doing minimal paid (20% of sales vs. 80% owned/earned)
   - Question: Does paid accelerate or undermine the owned/earned flywheel?

**Glossier's Strategic Advantage:** Built owned media foundation (Into The Gloss) FIRST ‚Üí earned media amplification (community advocacy) SECOND ‚Üí considering paid media LAST. Most brands do this backwards.

**Three Points of Tension in Distribution Strategy:**

**The 3 Cs Framework** - Constant tension between:

1. **Cost**
   - What's the economic model? Margin structure?
   - DTC = high margin (40%) but high CAC
   - Wholesale = low margin (5%) but retailer absorbs customer acquisition
   - Tradeoff: Control your economics vs. outsource distribution costs

2. **Coverage**
   - How many customers can you reach? Geographic scale?
   - DTC e-commerce = global reach but limited discovery
   - Wholesale (Sephora) = "10x revenue overnight" but loses direct relationship
   - Pop-ups/showrooms = experiential but limited geography
   - Tradeoff: Broad reach vs. depth of engagement

3. **Control**
   - How much control over brand experience, customer data, messaging?
   - DTC = full control (experience, data, feedback loop)
   - Wholesale = no control (sits on shelf next to 300 brands)
   - Tradeoff: Brand consistency vs. distribution leverage

**Glossier's Distribution Dilemma Through This Lens:**
- DTC: High control ‚úÖ, High cost ‚ùå, Limited coverage ‚ùå
- Wholesale: Low control ‚ùå, Low cost ‚úÖ, High coverage ‚úÖ
- Social commerce vision: Maintain control ‚úÖ, Lower cost (peer CAC ~$0) ‚úÖ, Scale coverage ‚úÖ ‚Üí Trying to win on all three dimensions

**Key Insight:** Most brands can't optimize all three simultaneously. Must choose 2 of 3. Glossier's bet is that social commerce technology breaks this constraint by enabling peer-to-peer distribution at scale.

### Synthesis of Learning
1. **[Community as moat]**: Glossier's 1.5M Into The Gloss readers created an insurmountable competitive advantage‚Äînot just customer acquisition but co-creation, R&D, and authentic advocacy. Big brands cannot buy this; it requires years of relationship-building before commercialization.

2. **[Scaling authenticity paradox]**: The core tension is maintaining "brand as peer" relationships at scale. Paid programs (influencers, ads, sales reps) introduce transactional elements that erode the friendship dynamic. Technology (social commerce platform) may be the only way to scale peer-to-peer connections without losing authenticity.

3. **[Owned/earned/paid media integration]**: Glossier demonstrates the power of content-first brand building (Into The Gloss owned media ‚Üí Instagram earned media ‚Üí DTC e-commerce). The question is whether paid media accelerates or undermines this flywheel. Evidence suggests paid should complement, not replace, organic channels.

### Applications to Future Situations
- Community-first brands must maintain the community relationship above revenue growth to sustain competitive advantage
- DTC brands face distribution dilemma: wholesale scale vs. brand dilution (pop-ups may be solution)
- Social commerce represents next evolution beyond traditional e-commerce for digitally-native brands

### Questions for Further Research
- What happened to Glossier post-2018? Did they pursue paid media/wholesale?
- How did the loyalty program perform if implemented?
- Can social commerce technology deliver on the vision of "merchandising opinions"?
- How did COVID-19 impact their showroom/pop-up strategy?
