# Aqualisa Quartz: Simply a Better Shower

## Quick Facts
- **Case #**: 9-502-030
- **Course**: [[MKT]]
- **Date Read**: 2025-10-13
- **Industry**: Home Improvement / Plumbing
- **Geography**: United Kingdom
- **Development Investment**: €5.8 million over 3 years
- **Patents Acquired**: 9 patents
- **Launch Date**: May 2001
- **Time Since Launch**: 4 months (September 2001)

## Executive Summary
> Harry Rawlinson, managing director of Aqualisa, faces a paradox: the company's revolutionary Quartz shower—which took 3 years and €5.8 million to develop—is technologically superior to all U.K. shower products in pressure, temperature control, ease of installation, and design. The product won top prizes at trade shows and received rave reviews from press and field test users. Yet 4 months after launch, sales are dismal (15 units/day vs. needed 100-200/day), with channel partners sitting on inventory and plumbers reluctant to adopt. Rawlinson must determine what's preventing adoption and develop a go-to-market strategy to achieve mainstream penetration before the product is written off as a failure.

## Case Context

### Company Background
**Aqualisa Overview**:
- U.K. shower manufacturer with strong reputation for quality
- Market position: #2 in mixing valves, #3 in overall U.K. shower market
- Premium brand known for great service and high-quality products
- 25% net return on sales, 5%-10% growth in mature market (pre-Quartz)
- Core products: Aquavalve 609 (60,000 units/year), Aquastream Thermostatic (20,000 units/year)

**Harry Rawlinson's Vision** (joined 1998):
- Recognized vulnerability: competitors catching up on quality, prices perceived as too high
- Service had slipped, 10% of showers still "went wrong" (not improving)
- Believed future was in innovation, not comfort with niche position
- Built R&D team from 6 to 20 engineers, invested in state-of-the-art testing facility
- Multiple products in development pipeline beyond Quartz

### Industry Landscape

**U.K. Shower Market Problems**:
- Only 60% of homes have showers (vs. 100% with bathtubs)
- Archaic Victorian-era gravity-fed plumbing still common
- Low water pressure (3-4 liters/min vs. 18 liters/min in U.S.)
- Frequent temperature fluctuations (dangerous scalding/freezing)
- Hard-to-turn valves, leaky seals, mechanisms gummed up with lime scale
- Showers frequently break down, requiring replacement
- Almost 50% of market is replacement showers (Exhibit 3)

**Existing Solutions (All Flawed)**:
1. **Electric Showers**:
   - Bulky white box visible in shower
   - Doesn't address poor water flow
   - Popular with DIY market (easy to install, one day)

2. **Mixer Shower Valves** (Manual or Thermostatic):
   - Requires 2-day installation with bathroom excavation
   - Additional booster pump needed for pressure (€350-€600)
   - Aqualisa's Aquavalve 609: €155 to manufacture, €675-€750 retail (60,000 units/year)

3. **Integral Power Showers**:
   - Combines thermostatic valve + booster pump
   - Bulky box on shower wall
   - Less reliable than separate components
   - Aqualisa's Aquastream: €175 to produce, €670 retail (20,000 units/year)

**Customer Segments**:
- **Premium**: Shop in showrooms, value style/design, take performance for granted
- **Standard**: Emphasize performance/service, rely on plumber recommendations
- **Value**: Focus on convenience/price, avoid excavation, rely on plumber selection
- **DIY Market**: Shop at B&Q/Home Depot equivalents, want cheap + easy installation
- **Property Developers**: Need reliable, nice-looking, multi-setting products at reasonable price

### Timeline of Events
- **1998**: Harry Rawlinson joins Aqualisa, prioritizes innovation
- **1998-2001**: 3 years of R&D, €5.8 million investment
  - Built cross-functional team (engineers, R&D, sales, marketing, designers, scientists)
  - 60 consumer field test sites
  - Developed 9 patents
- **May 2001**: Quartz launches at Bathroom Expo in London (wins top prize)
- **May-September 2001**: Sales stagnate at ~15 units/day
- **September 2001**: Rawlinson assesses situation, needs 100-200 units/day for mainstream success

## Key Protagonists

- **Harry Rawlinson (HBS '90)**: Managing Director of Aqualisa
  - Background: Joined 1998 with vision to innovate rather than coast on premium niche
  - Current challenge: Product that "should" be selling isn't—must diagnose and fix before market writes it off
  - Key insight: "Once you put a computer in the bathroom, the potential is unlimited!"
  - Pressure: Channel partners have inventory (1,000 units), only sold 81 in 4 months

- **Tim Pestell**: National Sales Manager, Aqualisa
  - Quote: "Plumbing hasn't changed since Roman times"
  - Sales force priorities: 90% servicing existing accounts, 10% new customer development
  - Direct relationships with loyal plumber network ("our plumbers")

- **Martyn Denny**: Director of Marketing, Aqualisa
  - Refers to loyal plumber network as "our plumbers"

## Central Problem/Decision

### The Question
> How should Harry Rawlinson handle the marketing of the Quartz shower to achieve mainstream adoption (100-200 units/day) before channel partners and the market write it off as a failure?

### Constraints
1. **Time Pressure**: Only ~2-8 months before product perceived as failed launch
2. **Channel Inventory**: Partners sitting on 1,000 units, only 81 sold—losing faith
3. **Current Traction**: ~15 units/day, need 6-13x improvement to break into mainstream
4. **Plumber Skepticism**: Historically distrust electronics (1980s push-button failures), reluctant to switch brands
5. **Consumer Awareness**: Low brand awareness (except Triton), consumers uninformed about options
6. **Sales Force Focus**: 90% time on existing accounts, limited bandwidth for new product push
7. **Price Perception**: Aqualisa already viewed as overpriced by market

### Success Metrics
- Achieve 100-200 units sold per day (mainstream penetration)
- Build plumber adoption and enthusiasm
- Convert channel partner skepticism into active promotion
- Establish Quartz as category-defining innovation
- Maintain premium positioning while achieving volume

## Analysis

### The Quartz Product: Revolutionary Innovation

**Technology Breakthrough**:
- Remote processor (shoe box size) contains thermostatic mixing valve + pump
- Can be located anywhere: under cabinet, behind wall, in closet, in ceiling
- Only requires: cold/hot water input + standard power outlet
- Single pipe + data cable from processor to showerhead
- One-touch electronic control on shower wall (push-button, red flashing light until ready)

**Installation Benefits**:
- **Traditional shower**: 2 days, significant excavation, €40-€80/hour plumber cost
- **Quartz shower**: Half-day installation (some plumbers reporting)
- So easy that apprentices with little experience can complete entire job
- Often eliminates excavation entirely (just drill single ceiling hole)

**Consumer Benefits**:
- Efficient, reliable water pressure and temperature
- One-touch control (no more fiddling with valves)
- Push button, wait for red light to stop flashing, get in shower
- Safe for kids (no scalding risk)
- Easy for elderly (no stiff valves to fight)
- "Wow factor" - consumers loved it in field trials

**Manufacturing Cost**: €175-€230 to produce

**Future Pipeline**:
- Body Jet product (horizontal water jets from wall, popular with women)
- Wireless remote control (turn shower on from bed before getting up)
- "Once you put a computer in the bathroom, the potential is unlimited!"

**Market Reception**:
- Won top prize at London Bathroom Expo (May 2001)
- Trade press raved: "clever", "elegant design", "genuinely new look at old problems"
- Featured on covers of prominent trade journals
- Field test consumers loved it ("wow factor")
- Plumbers in field trials raved: "It's just what we want!"

### The Paradox: Why Isn't It Selling?

**Sales Results** (4 months post-launch):
- Current: ~15 units/day
- Needed: 100-200 units/day for mainstream success
- Channel inventory: 1,000 units purchased, only 81 sold (8.1% sell-through)
- Risk: Product written off as niche failure in 6 months

**Potential Barriers to Adoption**:

1. **Plumber Resistance**:
   - Historically distrust electronics (1980s failures created lasting skepticism)
   - Extremely brand loyal (install 40-50 showers/year, stick to one brand)
   - Fear of unknown performance problems with unfamiliar products
   - Bungled installations require unpaid second visit
   - Take years to build expertise in brand's installation idiosyncrasies
   - "Our plumbers" contacted face-to-face, but few sales resulted

2. **Consumer Unawareness**:
   - Low brand awareness in market (only Triton has consumer brand recognition)
   - Consumers generally uninformed about shower options (Exhibit 4)
   - Can identify problems (low pressure, temperature swings) but not solutions
   - Quartz benefits (easy installation, electronics) not visible to end consumer
   - Standard/value segments rely entirely on plumber recommendations

3. **Channel Dynamics**:
   - **Trade shops** (plumbers' merchants): Stock based on demand, not features
      - Staff don't have time to learn 45,000 items
      - Focus on reliable product availability, not technical advice
      - Aqualisa available in only 40% of trade shops
   - **Showrooms**: High-end focus, prefer established premium brands (Hansgrohe)
      - Aqualisa in 25% of ~2,000 showrooms
      - Consultants may not understand/promote Quartz advantages
   - **DIY outlets**: Aqualisa not available (Gainsborough brand in 70% of 3,000 outlets)
      - Electric showers dominate (cheaper, easier for DIY)

4. **Value Proposition Misalignment**:
   - **Who cares about easy installation?**: Plumbers (saves them time/money), but they're resistant
   - **Who cares about performance?**: Consumers, but they rely on plumbers to select
   - **Who sees the benefits?**: No one in current go-to-market approach
   - Electronics as feature may be liability (distrust) rather than asset

5. **Pricing Perception**:
   - Aqualisa already viewed as overpriced
   - Quartz presumably positioned at premium (given €175-€230 cost vs. €155 for Aquavalve 609)
   - May reinforce "too expensive" perception

6. **Sales Force Bandwidth**:
   - 90% of time on existing account maintenance
   - Only 10% on new customer development
   - Limited capacity to evangelize new product

### Strategic Options Analysis

**Option 1: Direct-to-Consumer Marketing Campaign**
**Approach**: Build consumer demand to pull product through distribution
**Tactics**:
- TV/print advertising showcasing "wow factor" and one-touch convenience
- Focus on premium segment (showrooms) first
- Emphasize safety for kids, ease for elderly
- Create aspirational brand positioning

**Pros**:
- Addresses consumer unawareness directly
- Can differentiate on visible benefits (design, ease of use, safety)
- Premium segment values style/design, less price-sensitive
- Success could create pull-through demand

**Cons**:
- Expensive marketing spend for B2B/installer-driven market
- Standard/value segments still rely on plumber recommendations
- Doesn't address plumber resistance (who must install)
- Long payback period, may not fix problem in 6-month window
- Aqualisa has low brand awareness to build from

**Option 2: Aggressive Plumber Incentive Program**
**Approach**: Overcome plumber resistance through financial incentives and training
**Tactics**:
- Pay plumbers €50-€100 per Quartz installation
- Offer free product for plumber's own home
- Hands-on training sessions demonstrating half-day installation
- Warranty that covers plumber's costs for any installation problems
- Money-back guarantee if plumber doesn't save time

**Pros**:
- Directly addresses key bottleneck (plumber resistance)
- Plumbers control standard/value segment purchase decisions
- Financial incentives can overcome brand loyalty inertia
- Training builds expertise and confidence
- Success creates word-of-mouth among plumber community

**Cons**:
- Expensive incentive program (margins may not support €50-€100/unit)
- May cheapen brand perception
- Plumbers may take incentives but revert to old brands
- Doesn't scale if plumber shortage persists (6-month waits common)
- Reinforces plumber gatekeeping rather than disrupting channel

**Option 3: Target Property Developers (ShowerMax Brand Strategy)**
**Approach**: Focus on high-volume developer market where Quartz advantages shine
**Tactics**:
- Adapt Quartz for ShowerMax brand (developer-focused)
- Emphasize: reliable, nice-looking, works in multiple settings, reasonable price

- Pitch time savings: developers can complete projects faster
- Build volume to achieve scale economies

**Pros**:
- Developers don't face pressure/temperature issues (new homes, high-pressure systems)
- High volume per developer (can move needle on units/day)
- Developers value speed-to-market (half-day installation accelerates projects)
- Already proven with ShowerMax approach for Aquavalve technology
- Bypasses consumer and plumber resistance issues

**Cons**:
- Quartz over-engineered for developer needs (unnecessary features)
- Would need stripped-down version (cannib alizes premium positioning)
- Doesn't build consumer brand or market transformation
- May not achieve 100-200 units/day needed for mainstream
- Perpetuates perception of Aqualisa as B2B/developer brand

**Option 4: DIY/B&Q Channel Strategy**
**Approach**: Target DIY market where ease of installation is critical differentiator
**Tactics**:
- Make Quartz (or version) available through B&Q and DIY outlets
- Price aggressively (€400-€500 retail)
- Market on installation simplicity: "So easy, you can do it yourself"
- Bundle with clear video instructions
- Leverage existing Gainsborough brand presence (70% of 3,000 DIY outlets)

**Pros**:
- DIY market values easy installation above all else
- Eliminates plumber bottleneck entirely
- Large market opportunity (significant DIY segment in U.K.)
- Fast feedback loop (DIY consumers buy directly)
- Could achieve 100-200 units/day through retail volume

**Cons**:
- Destroys premium brand positioning
- DIY market expects bulky, unattractive products at low prices (conflicts with Quartz design)
- Showrooms and trade shops may drop Aqualisa if also in DIY channel
- Installation, while easier, still requires plumbing knowledge
- May not be truly "DIY-able" despite improvements

**Option 5: Showroom Partnership Program**
**Approach**: Make showrooms champions of Quartz through aligned incentives
**Tactics**:
- Exclusive Quartz availability in premium showrooms (remove from trade shops initially)
- Train showroom consultants as Quartz experts
- Higher margins for showrooms on Quartz vs. competitors
- In-showroom demonstrations with working Quartz display
- Partner with high-end plumbers who service showroom customers
- Co-marketing: showroom promotes Quartz, Aqualisa drives traffic to showroom

**Pros**:
- Showrooms serve premium segment (less price-sensitive, value design/innovation)
- Consultant-led sales process allows full education on benefits
- Working display demonstrates "wow factor" experientially
- Premium positioning preserved
- Quality plumbers who work with showrooms more open to innovation
- Exclusive distribution creates scarcity/desirability

**Cons**:
- Showrooms only in 25% of U.K. market for Aqualisa currently
- Premium segment is smaller (may not achieve 100-200 units/day volume)
- Alienates existing trade shop relationships
- Slow build (showrooms have long sales cycles for bathroom renovations)
- Doesn't address mass market opportunity

## Discussion Questions & Detailed Answers

### 1. Is the Quartz shower a good product? Why or why not?

**Answer: It depends on your definition of "good" - it's an exceptional technical innovation but a flawed commercial product.**

**YES - From Technical/Innovation Perspective**:
- Solves ALL major U.K. shower pain points: pressure, temperature stability, ease of use, reliability
- Revolutionary approach (remote processor) enables benefits impossible with traditional design
- Won industry awards, rave reviews from trade press, field test consumers loved it
- Robust IP protection (9 patents)
- Platform for future innovation (body jets, wireless control, etc.)

**BUT - From Market-Fit Perspective**:
- Value proposition misaligned with decision-makers (plumbers resist, consumers don't select)
- Electronics may be feature liability rather than asset (historical distrust)
- Doesn't address true bottleneck: plumber shortage (easier install doesn't matter if can't get plumber)
- Price point unclear but likely reinforces "Aqualisa is too expensive" perception
- Benefits invisible to end consumer in installation-driven market

**Conclusion**: The Quartz is a "good" product from an engineering standpoint but a **commercially flawed product** because it:
- Creates value for parties who can't/won't pay for it (plumbers save time but bill lump sum)
- Hides its key benefits from decision-makers (installation ease invisible to consumers)
- Requires behavior change from the most resistant group (plumbers with brand loyalty)
- Launches into a channel structure optimized for the old solution (trade shops stock commodity products)

**The Lesson**: A "good product" must not only solve problems but also **align value creation with value capture** through the existing market structure—or successfully disrupt that structure.

---

### 2. Why has the Quartz shower not been selling well?

**Root Cause: Misalignment Between Value Creation and Value Capture**

The Quartz creates tremendous value for three constituencies, but captures value from none:

1. **Plumbers** (Primary Beneficiaries):
   - Half-day install vs. 2 days = massive time/cost savings
   - Easy enough for apprentices = labor flexibility
   - No excavation = less mess/hassle
   - **But**: Plumbers have no incentive to adopt
     - They charge lump-sum quotes, don't share savings with consumers
     - Faster install = less billable hours (perverse incentive)
     - Fear of electronics and unfamiliar brand
     - Brand loyalty lock-in (takes years to build expertise)

2. **Consumers** (Ultimate Beneficiaries):
   - Better performance, one-touch convenience, safety, design
   - **But**: Consumers don't select products
     - Rely on plumber recommendations (standard/value segments)
     - Unaware Quartz exists or what it offers
     - Can't evaluate installation benefits (invisible)
     - Low brand awareness limits consideration

3. **Aqualisa** (Value Creator):
   - Revolutionary product, strong IP, innovation platform
   - **But**: Can't capture value created
     - Distribution channels have no incentive to push (same margin as easier-to-sell products)
     - Sales force bandwidth limited (90% on existing accounts)
     - Premium price reinforces "too expensive" perception
     - No one in value chain incentivized to evangelize

**Secondary Factors**:
- Electronics distrust from 1980s failures
- Plumber shortage means installation ease doesn't matter (can't get plumber regardless)
- Channel structure (trade shops) focused on availability, not education
- Consumer unawareness + low Aqualisa brand recognition

**The Deeper Problem: Innovator's Dilemma in Distribution**

Aqualisa faces a classic **channel conflict paradox**:
- To succeed, they need plumbers to recommend Quartz
- But plumbers benefit most from products that take LONGER to install (more billable hours)
- Quartz's core advantage (half-day installation) is actually a *disadvantage* to plumbers' economic model
- Even worse: plumbers who adopt Quartz can complete more jobs/week, potentially reducing total market demand for plumber hours

This creates a **perverse incentive structure** where the primary beneficiary (plumber) is economically motivated to NOT adopt the innovation.

**Why Traditional Solutions Won't Work**:
1. **More marketing to consumers**: Standard/value segments (majority) defer to plumber recommendations regardless of awareness
2. **Train the channel**: Trade shops have 45,000 SKUs, no time to learn; showroom consultants don't control installation
3. **Lower the price**: Doesn't solve plumber resistance; may even reinforce "something's wrong with it"
4. **Wait it out**: Channel partners losing faith (81/1,000 units sold), will write off product in 2-6 months

**The Real Question**: How do you sell a product that makes your distribution channel's life harder?

### 3. What should Harry Rawlinson do?

**Recommended Strategy: Two-Pronged "Bypass Then Build" Approach**

**Phase 1: Bypass the Bottleneck (Months 1-6) - Generate Momentum**

**Tactic 1A: Developer Blitz (ShowerMax Quartz)**
- Create stripped-down Quartz version for developer market
- Target luxury developers first (less price-sensitive, value speed-to-market)
- Pitch: Complete projects faster, reliable/attractive for buyers, future-proof technology
- Goal: Achieve 50-75 units/day from developer channel alone

**Tactic 1B: Showroom Exclusive Launch (Premium Segment)**
- Make Quartz exclusive to premium showrooms (remove from trade shops temporarily)
- Intensive training for showroom consultants (become Quartz experts)
- Install working display units in top 100 showrooms
- Higher margins for showrooms vs. competitor products
- Co-market with high-end plumbers who serve showroom customers
- Goal: Achieve 25-50 units/day from premium showroom channel

**Phase 1 Outcome**: 75-125 units/day, proving product viability and buying time

**Phase 2: Build the Mainstream (Months 6-18) - Scale Adoption**

**Tactic 2A: Plumber Certification Program**
- "Quartz Certified Installer" program with training + certification
- Benefits:
  - Free Quartz for plumber's own home
  - Priority service/support from Aqualisa
  - Listed in "Find a Quartz Installer" consumer directory
  - €25-50 per installation incentive (first 10 installs only, to build expertise)
- Make certification exclusive (must apply, limited spots) to create desirability

**Tactic 2B: Consumer Awareness Campaign (Targeted)**
- Focus on premium segment initially (showroom shoppers)
- Magazine advertising in home/design publications
- Emphasis: "The shower that thinks" (electronics as benefit, not liability)
- Testimonials from early adopters
- Drive traffic to showrooms with Quartz displays

**Tactic 2C: Trade Shop Re-Introduction**
- After 6 months of showroom exclusivity, expand back to trade shops
- Arm trade shop staff with simple talking points + demo videos
- "Quartz Certified Installers" drive pull-through demand
- Stock based on demonstrated demand rather than hope

**Phase 2 Outcome**: 150-250 units/day, achieving mainstream penetration

**Why This Approach Works**:

1. **Bypasses Initial Bottlenecks**:
   - Developers and showroom customers have different purchase dynamics
   - Doesn't rely on mass plumber conversion immediately
   - Generates revenue and momentum quickly

2. **Builds Evidence**:
   - Developer and showroom success proves product viability
   - Creates installed base for word-of-mouth
   - Gives skeptical plumbers social proof

3. **Aligns Incentives**:
   - Plumber certification creates exclusivity (flips from "resist change" to "get exclusive access")
   - Showroom margins align financial incentives
   - Consumer awareness creates pull-through demand (plumbers respond to customer requests)

4. **Preserves Premium Positioning**:
   - Showroom exclusivity reinforces premium brand
   - Developer channel separate brand (ShowerMax)
   - Avoids dilution through DIY/mass channels

5. **Scales Over Time**:
   - Phase 1 achieves immediate survival (75-125 units/day)
   - Phase 2 builds to mainstream success (150-250 units/day)
   - Creates foundation for future Quartz innovations (body jets, wireless)

**Quick Wins to Implement Immediately**:
- Install Quartz in homes of all 20 sales force members (become evangelists)
- Offer free Quartz to top 50 plumbers in "our plumbers" network (build advocates)
- Create simple 2-minute installation video showing apprentice completing job
- Negotiate exclusive placement in top 20 luxury showrooms (launch PR event)

### Key Insights from Aqualisa Case

**Innovation Adoption Requires Aligned Incentives**: Superior product insufficient without aligned incentives throughout value chain. Quartz saves plumbers time but they bill by lump sum, creating perverse disincentive to adopt time-saving product.

**Channel Power Dynamics**: In B2B markets with installer intermediaries, ultimate consumer has limited influence on product selection. Must win over gatekeepers (plumbers) or bypass them entirely.

**Feature vs. Benefit**: Electronics aren't inherently good/bad—depends on market context. In market with electronics distrust (1980s failures), leading with electronics may hinder rather than help adoption.

**First-Mover Disadvantage**: Pioneering innovations face skepticism and behavioral inertia. Sometimes better to let product mature in friendly segments (developers, showrooms) before mass market push.

**Segmentation for Launch**: Not all segments equally attractive for launch. Developer/premium segments have different purchase dynamics, less gatekeeping, and can provide proof-of-concept for mainstream.

## Personal Reflections & Key Takeaways

### Synthesis of Learning

This case crystallizes the **innovator's paradox**: creating superior value doesn't guarantee capturing that value. The Quartz is objectively better on every dimension that matters to consumers, yet fails in market because:

1. **Value creation ≠ Value capture**: Plumbers receive primary benefit (time savings) but have no incentive to advocate. Consumers receive secondary benefit (performance) but don't control selection.

2. **Distribution channel alignment critical**: When intermediaries control purchase decisions, must align their incentives or bypass them. Aqualisa tried to sell through existing channels without changing channel incentives.

3. **Launch sequencing matters**: Some segments more receptive than others. Developers and premium consumers bypass plumber gatekeeping, making them ideal launch segments to build momentum.

### Applications to Future Situations

- Any B2B product with end-user benefits but intermediary decision-makers
- Innovation launches where gatekeepers have incentive to resist
- Channel strategy when existing distribution misaligned with new product
- Overcoming adoption resistance through segmentation and sequenced rollout

### Questions for Further Research

- How much would plumber incentives need to be to overcome adoption resistance?
- Could Aqualisa license Quartz technology to competitors to achieve category transformation?
- What's the price elasticity of demand for showers in premium vs. value segments?
- How do U.K. consumers research major home improvement purchases?
