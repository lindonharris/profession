## Quick Facts
- **Case #**: 9-518-024
- **Course**: [[MKT]]
- **Date Read**: 2025-09-16
- **Industry**: Financial Services / Credit Cards
- **Geography**: United States

## Executive Summary
> In July 2017, Chase executives Pam Codispoti and Eileen Serra face critical decisions about the Chase Sapphire credit card portfolio after the wildly successful launch of the Sapphire Reserve card, which exceeded its 12-month sales target in just two weeks. They must determine how to maintain customer profitability after reducing the sign-on bonus from 100,000 to 50,000 points, manage portfolio differentiation across three Sapphire products, and respond to competitive moves from American Express and Citi.

## Case Context

### Company Background
- JPMorgan Chase operates four business lines: Commercial Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Asset & Wealth Management, and Consumer & Community Banking (CCB)
- CCB serves nearly half of all U.S. households with $44.9 billion revenue and $9.7 billion net income (2016)
- Chase ranks #1 or #2 in credit card issuance and payments volume
- Has 5,200 retail branches, 18,000 ATM locations, highest-rated mobile banking app

### Industry Landscape
- U.S. credit card industry: ~$3 trillion in sales (2016)
- Six major issuers control 78% market share:
  - JPMorgan Chase: 21.7%
  - American Express: 19.9%
  - Citigroup: 11.5%
  - Capital One: 11.0%
  - Bank of America: 8.9%
  - Discover: 4.7%
- Customer acquisition costs: $250-$500 per new cardholder
- Americans hold 636 million credit cards, average 2.35 cards per wallet
- Three revenue sources: cardholder fees, interest payments, interchange fees

### Timeline of Events
- 2006: Jamie Dimon identifies need to strengthen proprietary products
- 2007: Gordon Smith hired from Amex to lead Card Services
- 2009: Chase Sapphire (no-fee) launched
- 2011: Sapphire Preferred ($95 fee) launched
- 2014: Pam Codispoti joins from Amex; no-fee product de-emphasized
- 2016 August: Sapphire Reserve ($450 fee) launched with 100K bonus
- 2017 January: Bonus reduced to 50,000 points
- 2017 July: First anniversary approaching, renewal decisions pending

## Key Protagonists
- **Pam Codispoti**: President of Chase Branded Cards (HBS MBA '93)
  - Background: 18+ years at American Express before joining Chase in 2014
  - Key decisions: Launched Reserve card, managed bonus reduction

- **Eileen Serra**: Senior Advisor, former CEO of Chase Card Services
  - Background: Joined from Amex, created new strategy for affluent market
  - Key decisions: Launched market research, created Sapphire sub-brand

## Central Problem/Decision

### The Question
> How should Chase manage the Sapphire portfolio going forward to maintain profitability, differentiate three product tiers, and respond to enhanced competitor offerings while retaining the millennial customers acquired through the Reserve launch?

### Constraints
1. Economics pressured by high rewards costs approaching interchange fees
2. "Churners" gaming system for sign-up bonuses
3. Millennials' aversion to annual fees and revolving credit
4. Aggressive competitive responses from Amex and Citi
5. Need to avoid cannibalization across Sapphire products

### Success Metrics
- Customer renewal rates (traditional premium cards: 60-90%)
- New customer acquisition post-bonus reduction
- Customer lifetime value and profitability
- Market share in affluent segment
- Top-of-wallet status

## Analysis

### Strengths
- Strong brand equity: "understands me," "contemporary," "not my father's card"
- Ultimate Rewards platform with superior user experience
- Direct-to-advisor customer service differentiator
- Metal card creates tangible quality signal and social currency
- Strong millennial appeal (50% of Reserve customers under 35)
- Extensive branch network and digital capabilities
- Successful viral marketing and influencer strategy

### Weaknesses
- High customer acquisition costs exceeded projections
- Rewards costs approaching interchange fee levels
- Vulnerable to churner behavior
- Portfolio complexity with three similar products
- Net revenue rate pressure from acquisition costs

### Opportunities
- Deepen relationships with acquired affluent millennials
- Cross-sell other Chase products to new customers
- Expand "experiences" platform for differentiation
- Leverage social media enthusiasm and word-of-mouth
- Build on momentum in emerging affluent segment
- Partner with more travel/dining brands

### Threats
- Enhanced competitor products (Amex Platinum $550, Citi Prestige changes)
- Customer defection after bonus utilization
- Continued rewards arms race pressuring economics
- Low switching barriers in credit card industry
- Potential cannibalization within Sapphire portfolio

## My Analysis & Recommendations

### Assignment Question 1: Is Chase Sapphire Reserve a Good Product?

**Assessment Criteria & Analysis:**

**YES - It's a strong product based on:**

1. **Market Response**: Exceeded 12-month target in 2 weeks
2. **Customer Demographics**: 50% under 35 (valuable long-term segment)
3. **Brand Building**: Created "cult brand" status and social currency
4. **Competitive Positioning**: Forced Amex and Citi to enhance offerings
5. **Customer Experience**: Superior Ultimate Rewards platform, direct-to-advisor service

**Concerns:**
- Profitability pressure from high rewards costs
- Vulnerability to churners
- Sustainability of economics

### Assignment Question 2: Customer Acquisition Economics

**100,000 Point Bonus Analysis:**

**Customer Lifetime Value Calculations:**

**Transactors (Pay in Full Monthly):**
- Annual spend: $16,000
- Interchange revenue: $16,000 × 1.5% = $240/year
- Annual fee: $450
- Travel credit cost: ($300)
- Rewards cost: $16,000 × 1.5% = ($240)
- **Annual contribution margin: $150**
- Acquisition cost: ($375)
- Sign-on bonus cost: 100K points × $0.015 = ($1,500)
- **Year 1 Net: ($1,725)**

**LTV Calculation (assuming 90% retention rate):**
- LT = 1/(1-0.9) = 10 years
- LTV = $150 × 10 = $1,500
- **LTV - CAC = $1,500 - $1,875 = ($375)**
- **LTV/CAC ratio = 0.80** (below 1, unprofitable)

**Revolvers (Carry 50% Balance):**
- Annual spend: $16,000
- Average balance: $8,000
- Interest revenue: $8,000 × 20% = $1,600/year
- Interchange revenue: $240
- Annual fee: $450
- Travel credit: ($300)
- Rewards cost: ($240)
- **Annual contribution margin: $1,750**
- Total acquisition cost: ($1,875)
- **Year 1 Net: ($125)**

**LTV Calculation (assuming 90% retention rate):**
- LT = 1/(1-0.9) = 10 years
- LTV = $1,750 × 10 = $17,500
- **LTV - CAC = $17,500 - $1,875 = $15,625**
- **LTV/CAC ratio = 9.33** (excellent, highly profitable)
- **ROI = (LTV - CAC)/CAC = 833%**

**Churners/Dormants:**
- Spend: $4,000 (first 3 months only)
- Interchange revenue: $60
- Annual fee: $450 (but won't renew)
- Travel credit: ($300)
- Rewards cost: ($60)
- Sign-on bonus: ($1,500)
- Acquisition cost: ($375)
- **Total Loss: ($1,725)**
- **LTV = $0** (no renewal)
- **LTV/CAC ratio = 0** (complete loss)

**Portfolio Economics Assessment:**
Assuming customer mix of 30% transactors, 40% revolvers, 30% churners:
- Weighted LTV = (0.3×$1,500) + (0.4×$17,500) + (0.3×$0) = $7,450
- Weighted CAC = $1,875
- **Portfolio LTV/CAC = 3.97** (above 3 threshold for healthy SaaS-like business)
- **Portfolio ROI = 297%**

**50,000 Point Bonus Comparison:**
- Sign-on bonus cost reduced to $750 (vs $1,500)
- New CAC = $375 + $750 = $1,125
- Transactor LTV/CAC = 1.33 (marginal)
- Revolver LTV/CAC = 15.56 (excellent)
- Portfolio LTV/CAC = 6.62 (stronger economics)

### Assignment Question 3: Product Design for Customer Types

**Current Design Assessment:**

**Attracts RIGHT customers:**
- High annual fee filters out marginal users
- Travel/dining rewards appeal to affluent lifestyle
- Premium benefits create stickiness

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Huge sign-on bonus attracts churners
- Millennials tend toward transactor behavior
- Low switching barriers

**Recommendations:**
- Add spending milestones for bonus points throughout year
- Create retention bonuses at renewal
- Enhance non-transferable experiences

### Assignment Question 4: One-Year Anniversary Changes

**Retention Economics Analysis:**

**Current Renewal Risk:**
- Estimated renewal rate: 60-90% (industry standard for premium cards)
- At 70% renewal: 30% churn × acquired customers
- Lost LTV per churned customer: $15,000 (revolvers) to $1,350 (transactors)
- **Critical insight**: Every 10% improvement in retention = 11% increase in LTV

**Recommended Changes with ROI Analysis:**

1. **Retention Program (Cost: $200/customer):**
   - Anniversary bonus: 25,000 points ($375 value, $375 cost to Chase)
   - Expected retention improvement: 10-15%
   - **ROI**: For revolvers, 10% retention improvement = $1,750 additional LTV vs $375 cost
   - **Breakeven**: Need only 2.1% retention improvement to justify

2. **Spending Incentives (Cost: $100/customer/year):**
   - Quarterly 5x categories (like Freedom)
   - Milestone bonuses: 10K points at $30K annual spend
   - **Expected impact**: 20% increase in spending = $48 additional interchange revenue
   - **ROI**: Negative in year 1, positive over 3-year horizon

3. **Portfolio Differentiation:**
   - No-fee Sapphire: Discontinue (cannibalization risk)
   - Preferred ($95): Position at $75K-150K income
   - Reserve ($450): Position at $150K+ income
   - **Expected impact**: Reduce cannibalization by 50%, worth $500/customer in LTV

### Assignment Question 5: Competitive Strategy & Price Elasticity

**Annual Fee Price Elasticity Analysis:**
- Current fee: $450
- Estimated price elasticity: -0.8 to -1.2 (relatively inelastic due to high value perception)
- 10% fee increase ($495): Expected 8-12% volume loss
- Breakeven analysis: Need to retain 91% of customers for profit neutrality
- **Recommendation**: Hold fee steady, compete on value not price

**Competitive Response Modeling:**

**If I were Amex (Closed-loop advantages):**
- Increase sign-on bonus to 125K points (cost: $1,875)
- Enhance Centurion Lounge access (cost: $100/customer)
- Target business spending with 4x points (reduces margin by 20%)
- **Expected impact**: Slow Chase acquisition by 30%

**If I were Citi (International focus):**
- Match 100K bonus temporarily (6 months)
- Double fourth-night-free benefit (2x per year)
- Add Global Entry every 2 years (vs Chase's 4)
- **Expected impact**: Capture 20% of Reserve prospects

**Chase Defensive Strategy (Quantified):**
- **Switching Cost Building**:
  - Ultimate Rewards pooling across products = $200 additional value/year
  - Chase Trifecta (Freedom + Preferred + Reserve) = 30% higher retention
- **Ecosystem Lock-in**:
  - Cross-sell rate: 40% also have Chase checking
  - These customers show 50% lower churn (1.5x LTV)
- **Retention Investment**:
  - Spend $100/customer on surprise delights
  - Expected 5% retention improvement = $875 LTV gain for revolvers
  - ROI: 775%

### Recommended Action (Data-Driven)

**Strategic Pivot Based on Quantitative Analysis:**

**From Acquisition to Retention:**
- Current: LTV/CAC = 3.97 with 100K bonus (acceptable but pressured)
- Target: LTV/CAC > 5.0 through retention focus
- Path: Reduce bonus to 50K (saves $750/customer), invest $300 in retention
- Expected outcome: 15% retention improvement = $2,625 LTV increase

**Portfolio Optimization:**
1. **Discontinue no-fee Sapphire** (immediate)
   - Eliminates confusion, reduces servicing costs by $2M/year
2. **Reposition Preferred** ($95 fee)
   - Target: $75K-150K income, 3M prospects
   - Expected conversion: 5% = 150K new customers
3. **Elevate Reserve** ($450 fee)
   - Focus on $150K+ income, maximize revolvers
   - Target mix: 20% transactors, 50% revolvers, 30% churners

**Financial Projections (Year 2):**
- New customers: 200K (vs 500K in Year 1)
- Average LTV: $8,500 (vs $7,450)
- Total LTV created: $1.7B
- Marketing efficiency: 40% improvement in CAC payback

### Implementation Plan with Metrics

   - Target: 85% renewal rate
   - Investment: $75M
   - Expected return: $300M in retained LTV

2. **Quarter 1:** Spending incentives

   - Investment: $100M
   - 5-year NPV: $500M

4. **Quarter 3:** Portfolio cleanup

   - Conversion target: 30% to Preferred
   - Value capture: $45M annual fees

5. **Year 2:** Ecosystem expansion
   - Cross-sell target: 50% with checking
   - Expected LTV multiplier: 1.5x
   - Incremental value: $1B
