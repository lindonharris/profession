## üéØ Core Strategic Frameworks

### 1. Competitive Advantage Fundamentals
*Source: [Competitive Advantage - Rivkin](resources/Competitive%20Advantage%20-%20Rivkin%20HBS%20Case.pdf)*

#### The Central Equation
**Competitive Advantage = Wider wedge between Willingness to Pay (WTP) and Cost than competitors**

#### Key Concepts:
- **Added Value**: Value created with firm - Value created without firm
- **Value Creation vs Capture**: Creating value ‚â† Capturing value
- **Industry Effects**: Only 5-15% of profit variation
- **Within-Industry Effects**: 30-45% of profit variation

#### Three Strategic Paths:
1. **Differentiation**: ‚Üë‚Üë WTP with ‚Üë Cost
2. **Low-Cost**: ‚Üì‚Üì Cost with ‚Üì WTP
3. **Dual Advantage**: ‚Üë WTP AND ‚Üì Cost (rare)

### 2. Analytical Tools Arsenal

#### Porter's Five Forces
- **Purpose**: Industry attractiveness & competitive dynamics
- **Forces**: Rivalry, Suppliers, Buyers, Substitutes, New Entrants
- **Application**: Use for industry-level analysis, not firm-specific

#### Value Chain Analysis
- **Primary Activities**: Inbound Logistics ‚Üí Operations ‚Üí Outbound Logistics ‚Üí Marketing & Sales ‚Üí Service
- **Support Activities**: Infrastructure, HR, Technology, Procurement
- **Key Insight**: Look for reinforcing activities (red lines in Walmart example)

#### Activity System Mapping
*[Activity System Guide](resources/Activity%20System%20Mapping%20Guide.md)*
- Map interconnected strategic choices
- Identify reinforcement patterns
- Spot strategic themes

#### Value Maps
- Plot competitive positioning on key attributes
- Identify "strategic groups"
- Find white space opportunities

## üîç Cross-Case Patterns & Insights

### Pattern 1: Reinforcement is Key
- **Walmart**: Every activity reinforces EDLP
- **On**: Premium tech ‚Üí Premium price ‚Üí Premium retail ‚Üí Premium brand
- **Cola Wars**: Brand investment ‚Üí Premium pricing ‚Üí Marketing funds ‚Üí Brand investment

### Pattern 2: Strategic Trade-offs Create Barriers
- Companies that try to be "everything to everyone" fail
- Clear choices on what NOT to do are as important as what TO do
- Examples: Walmart (no frills), On (no discount channel), Opera (no populist programming)

### Pattern 3: Industry Structure Shapes Strategy Options
- **Commodities** (Aluminum): Cost position is everything
- **Branded Goods** (Cola): Marketing and distribution matter most
- **Platforms** (AI): Network effects and ecosystems win
- **Retail** (Walmart): Operational efficiency and scale

### Pattern 4: Competitive Advantage Patterns
| Company | Type | Wider Wedge Through | Sustainability Source |
|---------|------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Walmart | Low-Cost | Lower costs > Lower WTP | Reinforcing activity system |
| On | Differentiation | Higher WTP > Higher costs | Innovation + brand |
| Cola Brands | Differentiation | Brand premium | Marketing scale + distribution |
| Yanhai | Low-Cost | Scale economies | Capacity investments |
