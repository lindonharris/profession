## Grade Placement

**Middle Group - Solid Participation** (Middle 50% of section)
**Midterm Grade**: 2

## Specific Feedback

**Assessment Criteria**:
- Frequency of comments
- Whether comments were substantive and moved class discussion and learning forward
- Other dimensions: attendance and engagement

## Context

**Important Caveats**:
- Preliminary feedback based on limited data (only first 10 sessions)
- Strong participation in just one or two classes could have outsized impact at this point
- Historically, students in "can be improved" category have finished with Category I grades
- Perilous to "coast" if participation has been strong to date

**Grade Distribution**:
- Upper 30%: Strong participation
- Middle 50%: Solid participation
- Lower 20%: Most opportunities for improvement

**Note**: These groups do not correspond to distribution for final grades

## Looking Ahead

- Ample opportunity to improve with strong participation in remaining sessions
- Office hours available to discuss class participation
