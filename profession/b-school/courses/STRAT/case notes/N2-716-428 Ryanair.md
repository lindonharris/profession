# Ryanair: Dogfight over Europe (A)

## Quick Facts
- **Case #**: N2-716-428
- **Course**: [[STRAT]]
- **Class #**: 9
- **Date Read**: 2025-10-05
- **Industry**: Aviation
- **Geography**: Europe (Ireland, United Kingdom)

## Executive Summary
In April 1986, Irish startup airline Ryanair announced it would commence service between Dublin and London, facing formidable competitors Aer Lingus and British Airways on a major route for the first time. The Ryan brothers must assess their launch strategy and anticipate how established carriers will respond to their market entry.

## Case Context

### Company Background
- Founded by brothers Cathal and Declan Ryan
- Operating since 1985 with 14-seat turboprop between Waterford and London Gatwick
- First major route expansion: Dublin-London
- Entering competitive market dominated by flag carriers

### Industry Landscape
**European Aviation Regulation (Post-WWII to 1980s)**:
- National governments owned and subsidized "flag carriers" (e.g., British Airways, Air France, Lufthansa)
- Route structures developed to serve colonial aims
- International Air Traffic Association (IATA) set international fares as government-endorsed cartel
- Bilateral agreements regulated all aspects of air travel between country pairs
- "Pooling arrangements": flag carriers divided routes, capacity, and revenue
- Domestic service heavily regulated with government-set fares
- High barriers to entry for new airlines

**Pressures on Regulation**:
- Late 1950s: Economist magazine noted "too many airlines, most inefficient, undercapitalized, unprofitable"
- 1960s: Charter airlines bypassed regulations, grew rapidly (60% of European passengers by mid-1980s)
- 1970s: Financial straits from wide-body aircraft overcapacity, OPEC oil embargo, recession
- European flag carriers hit hard with heavily unionized staffs and high fixed costs
- 1978: U.S. Congress deregulated domestic airline industry

**UK-Specific Developments**:
- 1971: Civil Aviation Authority encouraged British Caledonian Airways (BCal) as "second force" to compete with BA
- 1979: Margaret Thatcher elected, market-oriented government
- Early Thatcher bill: regulators must give consumer interests equal weight to operator interests
- Thatcher privatization program included planned British Airways flotation

### Timeline of Events
- **Post-WWI**: Commercial airlines emerged in Europe
- **1930s-1940s**: Governments amalgamated airlines into national flag carriers
- **Post-WWII**: IATA formed, bilateral agreements regulated international travel
- **Late 1950s**: European flag carriers refocused on North Atlantic routes
- **1960s**: Charter airlines grew rapidly
- **1970s**: Financial difficulties across industry (fuel crisis, overcapacity, recession)
- **1977**: BA had 54,300 employees moving 14.5M passengers (vs. Delta: 31,000 employees moving 30.7M)
- **1978**: U.S. deregulated domestic airline industry
- **1979**: Margaret Thatcher elected in UK
- **1981**: BA suffered £102M loss on £1,760M revenue
- **1981-1985**: John King reduced BA staff to 38,000, Colin Marshall improved customer service
- **1984**: BA returned to record profits
- **1985**: Ryanair began operating Waterford-London Gatwick route (14-seat turboprop)
- **April 1986**: Ryanair announced Dublin-London service
- **1987**: BA privatization planned

## Key Protagonists
- **Cathal Ryan**: Co-founder of Ryanair
  - Background: Irish entrepreneur
  - Key decisions: Launched Ryanair, planning Dublin-London expansion

- **Declan Ryan**: Co-founder of Ryanair
  - Background: Irish entrepreneur
  - Key decisions: Co-founded airline, planning competitive entry

- **John King**: BA Chairman (1981-1984)
  - Background: Self-made millionaire with ball-bearing industry experience
  - Key decisions: Reduced BA staff from 54,300 to 38,000, closed loss-making routes

- **Colin Marshall**: BA CEO (1984+)
  - Background: Former Avis executive
  - Key decisions: Improved customer service, focused on business travelers

## Central Problem/Decision

### The Question
Should Ryanair proceed with its Dublin-London launch strategy, and how should it position itself to compete against Aer Lingus and British Airways?

### Constraints
1. Resource disadvantage vs. established flag carriers
2. Heavily regulated European aviation market
3. Facing competitors with extensive route networks and government backing
4. Limited track record (only Waterford-Gatwick route)
5. BA undergoing turnaround and preparing for privatization
6. UK moving toward deregulation but Europe still highly regulated

### Success Metrics
- Market share on Dublin-London route
- Load factors and profitability
- Ability to sustain operations against potential retaliation
- Customer acquisition and retention

## Analysis

### Strengths
- Successful operation of Waterford-Gatwick route demonstrates viability
- Upstart positioning may appeal to price-sensitive customers
- Timing coincides with UK deregulation movement
- Lower cost structure than flag carriers (potentially)

### Weaknesses
- Small scale (14-seat turboprop experience only)
- Limited resources vs. established competitors
- No brand recognition on major routes
- Lack of network effects and frequent flyer programs

### Opportunities
- UK regulatory environment shifting toward competition and consumer interests
- BA focused on profitability and privatization (may not want price war)
- Charter airlines demonstrated demand for low-cost travel
- Potential to exploit flag carriers' high cost structures
- Growing leisure travel demand

### Threats
- Retaliation from Aer Lingus and British Airways
- Predatory pricing by established carriers
- Regulatory barriers in broader European market
- BA's recent turnaround and focus on efficiency
- Established carriers' advantages: slots, gates, distribution, loyalty programs

## Financial Analysis
| Metric | British Airways (1977) | Delta (1977) | BA (1981) | BA (1984) |
|--------|------------------------|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| Employees | 54,300 | 31,000 | ~45,000 | 38,000 |
| Passengers | 14.5M | 30.7M | - | - |
| Revenue | - | - | £1,760M | Record profits |
| Profit/(Loss) | - | - | (£102M) | Profitable |
| Productivity | 267 pax/employee | 990 pax/employee | - | Improved |

**Key Insights**:
- European carriers (BA) significantly less efficient than US carriers (Delta) in 1970s
- BA reduced headcount by 30% (1981-1985) to improve efficiency
- BA returned to profitability by 1984 through cost-cutting and service improvements

## Key Exhibits

## Discussion Questions
1. What is your assessment of Ryanair's launch strategy?
2. How do you expect Aer Lingus and British Airways to respond to Ryanair's launch? Why?

## My Analysis & Recommendations

### Option 1: Aggressive Low-Price Entry
**Pros**:
- Exploits flag carriers' high cost structures
- Taps price-sensitive leisure market (proven by charter success)
- UK deregulation supports competitive entry
- BA focused on business travelers and privatization (may accommodate)

**Cons**:
- Risks severe price retaliation
- Limited resources to sustain price war
- May trigger coordinated response from both carriers
- Regulatory uncertainty in broader European market

### Option 2: Niche/Off-Peak Entry
**Pros**:
- Less threatening to incumbents (accommodation more likely)
- Lower capital requirements
- Can build operations gradually
- Targets underserved segments

**Cons**:
- Limited growth potential
- Difficult to achieve economies of scale
- May not differentiate sufficiently
- Incumbents can easily match niche offerings

### Option 3: Hybrid Strategy - Measured Aggression
**Pros**:
- Moderate pricing to gain share without triggering full retaliation
- Focus on service segments where BA is less competitive
- Build brand and operations before full-scale competition
- Position for deregulation wave

**Cons**:
- May be perceived as "stuck in the middle"
- Requires balancing act difficult to execute
- Competitors may still retaliate

### Recommended Action
**Proceed with moderate pricing strategy targeting leisure/price-sensitive travelers**

**Rationale**:
- BA's privatization focus and business traveler emphasis creates opening
- BA may accommodate rather than risk regulatory scrutiny during privatization
- Charter airline success proves market exists for low-cost options
- UK deregulation trend supports new entrant positioning

**Key to success**: Signal limited ambitions initially while building cost advantage for longer-term competition

### Implementation Plan
1. **Pre-launch**: Secure financing for 12-18 months of operations assuming competitive response
2. **Launch positioning**: Emphasize price value but avoid directly attacking flag carriers' premium positioning
3. **Initial operations**: Focus on leisure travelers, avoid peak business travel times initially
4. **Monitor response**: Prepared to adjust strategy based on Aer Lingus/BA reactions
5. **Build capabilities**: Develop operational efficiency to support sustainable cost advantage
