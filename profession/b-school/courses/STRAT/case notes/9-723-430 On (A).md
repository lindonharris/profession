## Discussion Questions

2. How has On succeeded?
3. How did On navigate the BTE (barriers to entry)?
4. What pricing model to recommend for Cyclon?

## My Analysis & Recommendations

### Option 1: Launch Cyclon with Premium Positioning
**Pros**:
- First-mover advantage in subscription footwear
- Aligns with sustainability brand values
- Creates recurring revenue stream
- Builds customer loyalty and data insights
- Differentiates from Nike/adidas

**Cons**:
- High operational complexity
- Uncertain consumer acceptance
- Risk of cannibalization
- Higher costs initially
- Requires behavior change

### Option 2: Delay Launch for Market Education
**Pros**:
- More time to refine operations
- Can observe early adopters in other industries
- Build consumer awareness gradually
- Reduce execution risk

**Cons**:
- Lose first-mover advantage
- Competitors may enter first
- Miss sustainability momentum
- Delay revenue diversification

### Recommended Action
> Proceed with limited Cyclon launch as experimental pilot with high-mileage runners, using data to refine before broader rollout. Price at Cyclon B ($15/month) to balance accessibility with margin requirements.

### Implementation Plan
1. Launch with 1,000 beta customers in Switzerland/Germany
2. Gather intensive usage and satisfaction data for 6 months
3. Refine operations, especially reverse logistics
4. Expand to US/UK markets with proven model
5. Scale gradually based on retention metrics

### Key Insights from Discussion
- Strategy is an integrated set of choices that position the firm in its industry to create and capture superior value over the long run
- External consistency: leverage amenable opportunities and neutralize threats
- Internal consistency: combine choices that create a distinct and hard-to-copy value proposition
- Creating competitive advantage requires doing things differently when diversifying into new business

### Alternative Perspectives
- Nike/adidas as competing BTEs (barriers to entry): means of competing with incumbents
- Ads budget allocation challenge
- Brand messaging focus on performance vs sustainability
- Inventory management vs key risks
- Total volume and shelf-filling approach
- Premium pricing allowing room for this DTC-only channel

### Professor's Takeaways
- Assessing synergies is critical when entering new markets
- Distribution as means to avoid direct competition
- Higher distribution efficiency (DTC) can offset lower gross profit margin
- Subscription model provides higher customer loyalty, lower customer acquisition costs
- Feasible model with integrated supply chain

## Personal Reflections

### Key Learnings
1. Business model innovation can be as powerful as product innovation in creating competitive advantage
2. Subscription models in traditional product categories require careful consideration of consumer behavior change
3. Sustainability can be a differentiator but must align with core business economics
4. Direct-to-consumer channels provide valuable data and margin advantages but require different capabilities

### Applications to Future Situations
- Consider how subscription models could transform traditional purchase categories
- Evaluate sustainability initiatives through both brand and financial lenses
- Importance of building operational capabilities before scaling innovative models

### Questions for Further Research
- What happened with Cyclon post-launch? (Go with lower risk option - this is experimental)
- How did competitors respond to On's subscription model?
- What were actual retention rates vs projections?
- Impact of Roger Federer partnership on brand equity
