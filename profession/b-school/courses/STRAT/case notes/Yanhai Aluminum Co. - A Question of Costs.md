# Yanhai Aluminum Co.: A Question of Costs
**Date**: 2025-09-03
**Course**: STRAT - RC Strategy

## Introduction
### Introduction 
 
Min Yang, CEO of Yanhai Aluminum, must decide whether to recommend a $7 billion expansion and greening of the company’s Yunnan smelter, its only hydro-powered plant. The proposed investment would add capacity and automation to reduce emissions and position Yanhai as a leader in “green aluminum,” potentially enabling it to charge a price premium. But aluminum prices are at historic lows, and three out of four of Yanhai’s smelters are running at a loss. The board requires a 15% return on investment, forcing Yang and her team to assess the project’s viability using detailed cost data, global supply curve modeling, and uncertain demand forecasts.

## Assignment Questions
 
 
 - Should Yanhai invest in the proposed expansion and greening of the Yunnan plant? Use the companion spreadsheet to assess the economics of the project. Support your recommendation with both qualitative and quantitative analysis. 
 - Which of the two supply curves—Liu’s or Zhou’s—do you find more persuasive, and why? What assumptions underlie each curve, and how do they affect your view of future aluminum prices? *(Erratum: Please note that the footnote for Zhou’s supply curve should read as follows: Costs included—Electricity, alumina, plant fuel, consumables, maintenance, labor (hourly), freight, financing, marketing, closing costs.) *
 - Is it strategically valuable for Yanhai to become a ‘green aluminum’ leader—even if short-term financial returns are uncertain? How should Yang weigh long-term positioning versus near-term ROI?
