### Cost Structure Analysis (Expedition Segment)

#### Baseline: Typical 150-bed vessel at 90% occupancy (Exhibit 7)
| Cost Category | $/PCN | % of Revenue |
|---------------|-------|--------------|
| Realized price | $1,463 | 100% |
| Travel agent commission | $146 | 10% |
| All crew | $103 | 7% |
| Food & beverage | $92 | 6.3% |
| Fuel | $89 | 6.1% |
| Other operations | $139 | 9.5% |
| Marketing | $151 | 10.3% |
| G&A | $332 | 22.7% |
| **Total Operating Costs** | **$1,052** | **71.9%** |
| **EBITDA** | **$411** | **28.1%** |

#### Hurtigruten 500-bed vessel analysis

**Scenario 1: 90% occupancy (450 passengers)**
Key adjustments from case facts:
- **Crew costs**: Scale advantage - maritime crew only 40 vs 25 (60% increase for 3.3x passengers), hotel/expedition staff scale similarly → ~$65-70/PCN
- **Food & beverage**: 40% lower for "upper premium" vs luxury → ~$55/PCN
- **Fuel**: +22% total fuel for 500-bed vessel, spread across more passengers → ~$30/PCN
- **Marketing**: 20% larger team than Lindblad but spread across larger base → ~$80/PCN
- **G&A**: 20% larger headquarters but massive scale advantage → ~$150/PCN
- **Other costs**: +17% total but spread across more passengers → ~$50/PCN

Estimated total costs: ~$580/PCN vs $1,052 baseline = **45% cost advantage**

**Scenario 2: 75% occupancy (375 passengers)**
Fixed costs spread across fewer passengers:
- Crew remains largely fixed → ~$78/PCN
- Fuel slightly reduced but mostly fixed → ~$35/PCN
- Marketing/G&A spread thinner → ~$95/PCN and ~$180/PCN
- Total costs: ~$700/PCN = **33% cost advantage diminishing**

**Scenario 3: 30% occupancy (150 passengers - matching typical ship passenger count)**
Same fixed costs, minimal passengers:
- Crew costs per passenger triple → ~$195/PCN
- All fixed costs dramatically increase per passenger
- Total costs: ~$1,400-1,500/PCN = **35-40% cost disadvantage**
- EBITDA potentially negative at realized prices

**Key insights:**
1. Hurtigruten's 500-bed vessels have significant cost advantages ONLY at high occupancy
2. The business model is extremely sensitive to capacity utilization
3. At 30% occupancy, Hurtigruten would have higher costs than smaller competitors despite same passenger count
4. This explains why warm-water expansion may be necessary - to maintain high year-round utilization

## Discussion Questions

### Assignment Questions (STRAT Class 7)
1. **How structurally attractive is the market for expedition cruises?**
2. **How does Hurtigruten's cost structure in expedition cruises compare to the cost structure of a typical expedition cruise company like the one shown in Exhibit 7?**
   - Analysis at 90% occupancy (matching typical company)
   - Analysis at 75% occupancy (current Hurtigruten expedition occupancy)
   - Analysis at 30% occupancy (stress test scenario)
3. **In the market for expedition cruises, should Hurtigruten continue to be a polar specialist? Or should it aim to operate extensively in warm waters?**

### Additional Discussion Points
1. What are Hurtigruten's core capabilities and how transferable are they to warm-water markets?
2. How should Hurtigruten position itself against luxury competitors like Ponant and Lindblad?
3. Is the polar market defensible given the incoming capacity surge?
4. How can Hurtigruten leverage its 500-passenger ships as a competitive advantage rather than liability?

## My Analysis & Recommendations

### Market Attractiveness Assessment (Assignment Q1)
Using Porter's Five Forces:
- **Supplier Power (Low-Medium)**: Shipyards have limited capacity but multiple buyers
- **Buyer Power (Medium)**: Travel agents control 70% of bookings; customers price-sensitive at margins
- **Threat of Substitutes (High)**: Conventional cruises, land-based travel, adventure tourism
- **Threat of New Entrants (Medium)**: High capital requirements but attractive returns drawing new players
- **Rivalry (Increasing)**: Capacity doubling by 2024; differentiation becoming crucial
- **Overall**: Moderately attractive but deteriorating with capacity surge

### Relative Cost Analysis (Assignment Q2)
**Hurtigruten's 500-bed vessels vs. typical 150-bed:**

| Occupancy | Passengers | Cost/PCN | vs. Typical | Competitive Position |
|-----------|------------|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| 90% | 450 | ~$580 | -45% | Strong advantage |
| 75% | 375 | ~$700 | -33% | Moderate advantage |
| 30% | 150 | ~$1,400-1,500 | +35-40% | Severe disadvantage |

**Critical insights:**
- Scale economies are powerful but fragile - dependent on high utilization
- Fixed cost structure creates operating leverage that cuts both ways
- Break-even occupancy appears to be around 60-65%
- This analysis strongly supports geographic diversification to maintain utilization

### Strategic Options Assessment (Assignment Q3)

#### Option 1: Remain Polar Specialist
**Pros**:
- Leverage existing expertise and brand equity
- Avoid direct competition with established warm-water players
- Focus resources on defending #1 position
- Maintain authentic Norwegian/polar positioning

**Cons**:
- Face massive capacity increase (100%+ by 2024)
- Limited growth potential
- Seasonal constraints
- Risk of commoditization

#### Option 2: Expand to Warm Waters
**Pros**:
- Access 45% of total market
- Year-round vessel utilization (critical for 500-bed economics)
- Diversification from polar capacity surge
- First-mover with 500-passenger expedition ships
- Natural transition routes already needed

**Cons**:
- Dilution of polar specialist positioning
- Competing against established players
- Norwegian brand may not translate
- Execution risk in new geographies

### Recommended Action
> **Pursue selective warm-water expansion** focusing on "expedition-first" destinations that align with Hurtigruten's Norwegian explorer heritage.

**Rationale based on cost analysis:**
1. The 500-bed vessel economics REQUIRE high utilization (>75%) to maintain cost advantages
2. Polar-only strategy cannot provide year-round utilization needed
3. At low occupancy (30%), Hurtigruten becomes the highest-cost operator
4. Warm-water expansion is not optional but essential for the 500-bed model to work

### Implementation Plan
1. **Year 1**: Test 2-3 warm-water routes during transition seasons
2. **Year 2**: Expand to Pacific Islands and African coasts (lower competition)
3. **Year 3**: Full multi-region positioning with 60/40 polar/warm split
4. **Ongoing**: Maintain environmental leadership across all regions
