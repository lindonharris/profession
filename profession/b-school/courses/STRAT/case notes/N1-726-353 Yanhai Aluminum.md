# Yanhai Aluminum Co.: A Question of Costs

## Quick Facts
- **Case #**: N1-726-353
- **Course**: [[STRAT]]
- **Date Read**: 2025-09-03
- **Industry**: Aluminum / Primary Metals
- **Geography**: China (Yunnan Province)

## Executive Summary
> Min Yang, CEO of Yanhai Aluminum, faces a critical $7 billion investment decision to expand and "green" the company's hydro-powered Yunnan smelter. With aluminum prices at historic lows ($1,811/ton) and three of four smelters losing money, Yang must determine if the project can meet the board's 15% ROI requirement while positioning Yanhai as a green aluminum leader in China's evolving regulatory landscape.

## Case Context

### Company Background
- **Yanhai Aluminum**: Major Chinese aluminum producer with four smelters
  - Three coal-powered plants: Binzhou, Huimin, Zouping

## Class Discussion Notes

### My Participation
- **Times Spoken**: 0
- **Cold Called**: No

### Strategic Decision Framework
The class emphasized a systematic **decision framework** for the Yunnan expansion:
- **Reasons for support**: Chinese government seeking support for new green projects, market demand for green aluminum, existing hydroelectric facility
- **Reasons against**: Uncertainty of prices/value, uncertainty of technology
This balanced evaluation demonstrates that major capital investments require weighing strategic opportunities against operational risks.

### Market Positioning Insights
Discussion highlighted the **4% premium for green aluminum** as crucial to the investment case. The convergence of regulatory push ("Chinese govt seeking support") and market pull ("Market demand for 'green aluminum'") creates a compelling strategic window, even if near-term financials are challenging.

### Operational Advantages Discussion
The class recognized that the **"Existing facility in Yunnan which is already hydroelectric"** represents a critical strategic asset. Unlike competitors who must build from scratch, Yanhai can leverage existing infrastructure—a key competitive advantage when environmental considerations increasingly matter.

### Risk Assessment Framework
Two critical uncertainties dominated discussion:
- **"Uncertainty of prices/value"**: Commodity price volatility makes ROI projections fragile
- **"Uncertainty of technology"**: Inert anode breakthroughs could obsolete automation investments

The class emphasized that managing these risks requires real options thinking rather than static NPV analysis.

### Financial Analysis Deep Dive
Detailed **Phase 1 ROI Calculations** walked through:
- Investment: $1.5B
- 4% premium on $1,811 = $72/ton
- Cost savings = $113/ton
- Total gain: ($72 + $113) × 1,200,000 = $223,000,000
- ROI = 14.8% (vs. 15% target)

The near-miss on Phase 1 ROI suggests the decision is finely balanced, requiring careful judgment about future price trajectories.

### Supply Curve Debate
The question **"Which of Liu's/Zhou's supply curves are more persuasive?"** generated extensive discussion about underlying assumptions:
- **Liu's curve** (includes all costs): Appropriate for long-term equilibrium
- **Zhou's curve** (ANSC only): Better for short-term price predictions

The class concluded that different time horizons require different analytical frameworks.

### Professor's Takeaways
- Commodity markets exhibit significant price volatility around the "kink" in supply curves
- Sunk costs create asymmetric responses to demand changes
- Strategic positioning sometimes requires accepting below-hurdle returns
- Real companies (China Hongqiao) did invest and were rewarded when prices rose

## Personal Reflections & Key Takeaways

### Synthesis of Learning

#### The Commodity Market Paradox
The case brilliantly illustrates how rational individual decisions (keep producing if P > ANSC) create collective irrationality (oversupply depressing prices). The distinction between shutdown decisions (ANSC) and investment decisions (ATC) explains why industries with high sunk costs experience prolonged periods of low profitability. Understanding this dynamic is crucial for timing major capital investments.

#### Strategic Value Beyond Financial Returns
The 14.8% Phase 1 ROI—just shy of the 15% target—forces a critical question: Should strategic positioning trump financial hurdles? The class consensus that becoming a green aluminum leader has option value beyond immediate returns reflects sophisticated thinking about competitive advantage in transitioning industries.

#### The Supply Curve as Strategic Tool
Liu's and Zhou's contrasting supply curves aren't just academic exercises—they represent fundamentally different worldviews about market dynamics. Liu's inclusion of all costs assumes rational long-term equilibrium, while Zhou's focus on ANSC reflects the messy reality of sunk assets and exit barriers. Successful strategists must toggle between these perspectives.

#### Risk Management Through Phasing
The two-phase structure isn't just financial engineering—it's risk management. Phase 1's near-acceptable returns provide learning and optionality, while Phase 2 requires higher conviction. This approach balances commitment with flexibility, a crucial capability in volatile commodity markets.

#### The China Context
The case subtly weaves China's unique dynamics—government support for green projects, capacity swap requirements, rapid industrial transformation—into the decision. Yanhai's choice isn't just about aluminum economics but positioning within China's state-guided capitalism.

#### Learning from the Update
China Hongqiao's actual investment and subsequent success when aluminum prices rose above $2,141 in 2021 validates the strategic logic. The COVID impact was limited, and the green transition accelerated—reminding us that bold moves during downturns often capture disproportionate value in recoveries.

### Applications to Future Situations
- Use different cost concepts (ANSC vs. ATC) for different decisions
- Consider strategic option value beyond static financial metrics
- Phase large investments to maintain flexibility
- Time commodity investments counter-cyclically
- Account for regulatory trends in long-term positioning

### Questions for Further Research
- How do other commodity industries manage the sunk cost problem?
- What financial instruments could hedge aluminum price risk effectively?
- How quickly are inert anode technologies advancing?
- What determines the green premium stability across industries?
- How do Chinese state-owned enterprises evaluate strategic vs. financial returns?
