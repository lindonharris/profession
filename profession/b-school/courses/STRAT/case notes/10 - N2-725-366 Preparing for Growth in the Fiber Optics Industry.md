# Preparing for Growth in the Fiber Optics Industry

## Quick Facts
- **Case #**: N2-725-366
- **Course**: [[STRAT]]
- **Class #**: 10
- **Date Read**: 2025-10-05
- **Industry**: Telecommunications / Fiber Optics
- **Geography**: North America

## Executive Summary
In January 2015, two consulting teams (one for Alcatel, one for Corning) must independently recommend capacity expansion strategies in the North American fiber optics cable market. Alcatel faces three options: no expansion, small plant (4.5M fiber-km/year), or large plant (9.5M fiber-km/year). The decision involves analyzing demand scenarios (consensus: 45M fiber-km vs. low: 31.5M fiber-km), constructing industry supply curves, and anticipating competitor responses in this oligopolistic market.

## Case Context

### Company Background

**Alcatel:**
- Largest producer of fiber optic cable in Europe
- Significant producer in North America
- Plants in: France, Germany, United States
- Currently evaluating North American expansion

**Corning:**
- Largest producer of fiber optic cable in North America
- Plants in: United States, Germany, United Kingdom
- Also considering similar expansion plans (creates competitive dynamic)

**Other Major Players (No North American Expansion Plans):**
- **Lucent**: North American producer facing financial challenges
- **Pirelli**: European and North American producer, no expansion plans
- **Samsung LG**: South Korean/North American producer, focused on Asia-Pacific market

### Industry Landscape

**Market Structure:**
- Relatively concentrated market
- Few significant **integrated producers** (produce optical fiber + manufacture cable)
- Many minor **independent producers** (purchase fiber, make cable only)

**Key Differences:**
- **Integrated producers**: Cabling equipment fully linked to fiber production, cannot be redeployed to other cable types (high sunk costs)
- **Independent producers**: Flexible cabling equipment, easily redeployed to other cable types (low switching costs)

**Market Segments (by demand %):**
1. **Long-haul communications**: >50% - driven by new long-distance companies and network conversions
2. **Feeder/local telecommunications**: ~25% - network upgrades and new market entrants
3. **Cable television**: ~15% - cable network expansion
4. **Other applications**: Remainder

### Timeline of Events
- **January 2015**: Two consulting teams (Alcatel and Corning) begin parallel assignments
- **Decision horizon**: North American capacity expansion decisions
- **Demand scenarios**:
  - Consensus projection: 45 million fiber-kilometers
  - Low projection: 31.5 million fiber-kilometers

## Key Protagonists
- **Consulting Team for Alcatel**: Five recently graduated MBAs tasked with recommending capacity expansion strategy
  - Background: New associates at prestigious consulting firm
  - Key decisions: Whether to build new plant, and if so, what capacity

- **Consulting Team for Corning**: Five MBA associates at competing consulting firm
  - Background: Fresh MBA recruits on parallel assignment
  - Key decisions: Same strategic options as Alcatel (creates game theory scenario)

## Central Problem/Decision

### The Question
Should Alcatel expand its North American fiber optics cable production capacity, and if so, which capacity option should it pursue?

### Three Options:
**A. No Expansion**: Maintain current capacity

**B. Small Plant**: Build facility with 4.5 million fiber-kilometers annual capacity

**C. Large Plant**: Build facility with 9.5 million fiber-kilometers annual capacity

### Assignment Questions

**Question 1**: Assume consensus demand projection (45M fiber-km) is correct:
  - A. If no new capacity added: What is market price? What is Alcatel's profit?
  - B. If Alcatel builds small plant: What is market price? What is Alcatel's profit?
  - C. If Alcatel builds large plant: What is market price? What is Alcatel's profit?

**Question 2**: Based on consensus demand projection, do you recommend Alcatel build a new plant? Why or why not?

**Question 3**: If low demand projection (31.5M fiber-km) is correct, does your recommendation change?

### Constraints
- Integrated producers face sunk costs (equipment cannot be redeployed)
- Independent producers have flexible equipment (low switching costs)
- Competitive dynamics: Corning making simultaneous decision
- Page 12 lists correct assumptions for determining sunk costs in supply curve construction
- Must use "Fiber Optics Industry Spreadsheet" for analysis

### Success Metrics
- Profitability under different demand scenarios
- Market price equilibrium
- Competitive positioning vs. Corning
- Risk mitigation under demand uncertainty

## Analysis

### SWOT Analysis

**Strengths:**
- Alcatel is largest producer in Europe, significant in North America
- Established manufacturing presence (France, Germany, US)
- Integrated producer (controls optical fiber supply)

**Weaknesses:**
- High sunk costs (integrated production equipment cannot be redeployed)
- Vulnerability to demand uncertainty
- Capacity decision made without knowing Corning's choice

**Opportunities:**
- Growing demand in long-haul communications (>50% of market)
- Network upgrade cycles driving feeder/local telecom demand (~25%)
- Cable TV expansion (~15% of market)

**Threats:**
- Corning making simultaneous expansion decision (game theory problem)
- Demand uncertainty (45M consensus vs. 31.5M low scenario)
- Lucent's financial challenges could lead to competitive responses
- Independent producers have lower switching costs (more flexibility)

## Financial Analysis
[To be filled using Fiber Optics Industry Spreadsheet - requires constructing industry supply curve with sunk cost assumptions from Page 12]

### Key Analysis Steps:
1. Construct industry supply curve (identify sunk vs. relevant costs)
2. Analyze market price equilibrium under different capacity scenarios
3. Calculate Alcatel profit for each option (A, B, C)
4. Perform sensitivity analysis for demand scenarios (45M vs. 31.5M)
5. Game theory analysis: anticipate Corning's decision

## Discussion Questions

### From Assignment Context:

1. **Assume the consensus demand projection (45 million fiber-kilometers) is correct.**
   - A. If no new capacity is added, what will be the market price for fiber optic cable? What is the profit for Alcatel under this scenario?
   - B. If Alcatel builds a small plant, what will be the market price for fiber optic cable? What is the profit for Alcatel under this scenario?
   - C. If Alcatel builds a large plant, what will be the market price for fiber optic cable? What is the profit for Alcatel under this scenario?

2. **Based on the consensus demand projection, do you recommend that Alcatel build a new plant? Why or why not?**

3. **If the low demand projection (31.5 million fiber-kilometers) is correct, does your recommendation change?**

## Class Discussion Notes

### Key Insights from Professor

**Sunk vs. Non-Sunk Costs:**
- Non-sunk fixed costs example: Depreciation for independent producers
- Independent producers have flexible equipment that can be redeployed to other cable types
- This depreciation is NOT sunk because the equipment has alternative uses

**Capacity Expansion Impact:**
- When you add significant capacity to a commodified industry, prices tend to come down
- Industry becomes more price-competitive as supply increases relative to demand
- Critical strategic consideration for capacity decisions

**Demand Curve Characteristics:**
- Demand curves tend to be **inelastic** when the product is:
  - A critical input (fiber optic cables are essential for telecommunications infrastructure)
  - Relatively low-cost compared to the much larger product base (cables are small fraction of total network infrastructure costs)
- Inelastic demand means quantity demanded doesn't change much with price changes
- Customers will pay for fiber optics even if prices rise because it's essential and represents small portion of total costs
