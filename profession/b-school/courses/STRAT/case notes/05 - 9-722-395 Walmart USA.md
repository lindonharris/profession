# Walmart USA - Searching for Growth

## Quick Facts
- **Case #**: 9-722-395
- **Course**: [[STRAT]]
- **Date Read**: 2025-09-16
- **Industry**: Retail/Discount Retail
- **Geography**: United States

## Executive Summary
> In early 2022, CEO Doug McMillon faces strategic decisions about Walmart's growth priorities after a successful but challenging 2021. Despite 8% same-store sales growth and e-commerce success, Walmart's stock underperforms competitors. McMillon must decide among three strategic initiatives: doubling down on e-commerce, upscaling merchandise and shopping experience, or penetrating urban markets with Neighborhood Markets.

## Case Context

### Company Background
- Founded in 1962 by Sam Walton in rural Arkansas
- Grew from humble roots to one of the largest companies globally by revenue, employment, and market cap
- Pioneer of EDLP (Every Day Low Prices) strategy
- 5,000+ U.S. stores with $350+ billion in sales by 2022
- Employs 1.6 million people in the U.S. alone

### Industry Landscape
- Intense competition from Amazon in e-commerce
- Traditional competitors include Kroger, Target, Dollar General
- Grocery business dominates sales mix (56% by 2021)
- E-commerce penetration accelerating across retail categories
- Labor market pressures and supply chain disruptions post-pandemic

### Timeline of Events
- 1962: First Walmart opened in Rogers, Arkansas
- 1988: Introduction of SuperCenters (grocery + discount store)
- 1998: Launch of Neighborhood Markets for urban penetration
- 2014: Doug McMillon appointed CEO
- 2016: Acquisition of Jet.com for $3.3 billion
- 2020: Launch of Walmart+ membership program
- 2021: E-commerce sales nearly doubled from 2019

## Key Protagonists
- **Doug McMillon**: CEO since 2014
  - Background: Started as teenager loading trucks, MBA from University of Tulsa, former CEO of Sam's Club
  - Key decisions: Raised minimum wages, acquired digital brands, launched Walmart+
  - Described as "extremely affable, charming and engaging"

## Central Problem/Decision

### The Question
> Which growth initiative should McMillon prioritize for 2022 capital allocation: upscaling merchandise and shopping experience, penetrating urban areas with Neighborhood Markets, or doubling down on e-commerce?

### Constraints
1. Traditional business appears to have limited growth opportunities
2. E-commerce investments face low margins in grocery
3. Previous upscaling attempts have failed twice
4. Urban markets remain highly competitive
5. Stock price underperforming competitors despite operational success

### Success Metrics
- Same-store sales growth
- Market share gains (especially in younger demographics)
- Stock price performance relative to competitors
- E-commerce growth and profitability
- Customer satisfaction scores

## Analysis

### Strengths
- Largest U.S. retailer with unmatched scale and distribution network
- Strong supply chain and logistics capabilities (200+ distribution centers)
- Cost leadership position with 6-10% price advantage
- Growing e-commerce presence (#2 after Amazon)
- Successful omni-channel integration (click-and-collect)
- 15+ million Walmart+ members
- Market share gains with Gen Z in groceries (up 3.3%) and household products (up 5.1%)

### Weaknesses

- E-commerce losses (~$1 billion in 2019)
- Stock underperformance (flat in 2021 vs S&P +27%)
- Lower gross margins than Target (24.8% vs 29.3%)

### Opportunities
- E-commerce growth potential ($43B in 2021 → projected $75B in 2022, $100B in 2023)
- Urban market penetration with Neighborhood Markets
- Upscaling to attract higher-income customers
- Walmart+ membership expansion
- Advertising platform (Walmart Connect) revenue growth
- Last-mile delivery services for third parties (GoLocal)

### Threats
- Amazon's dominance in e-commerce
- Target's successful upscaling strategy
- Rising labor costs and worker expectations
- Supply chain disruptions
- Intense price competition from Dollar General
- Changing consumer preferences toward quality over price

## Discussion Questions
1. What were the sources of Walmart's competitive advantage by the early 2000s?
2. Which of the three strategic initiatives (upscaling, urban penetration, e-commerce) would you prioritize as McMillon? Why?
3. How sustainable is Walmart's competitive advantage in the face of Amazon's growth?
4. Can Walmart successfully compete in multiple strategic dimensions simultaneously?

## My Analysis & Recommendations

### Option 1: Double Down on E-commerce
**Pros**:
- Defensive necessity against Amazon
- Growing consumer preference for online shopping
- Leverages existing store network for fulfillment
- Walmart+ showing promise with 15M members
- Strong position in online grocery ($27B sales)

**Cons**:
- Low margins, especially in grocery
- Difficult last-mile economics
- History of losses (~$1B in 2019)
- Amazon's significant lead in infrastructure and technology
- Need for continued massive capital investments

### Option 2: Upscale Merchandise & Experience
**Pros**:
- Higher margins potential (Target example: 29.3% gross margin)
- Differentiation from Dollar General
- Appeal to younger, higher-income demographics
- Some success with Allswell brand

**Cons**:
- Two previous failures (Metro 7, digital brands)
- Brand perception challenges ("Walmart brand doesn't translate")
- Conflicts with core EDLP positioning
- Requires significant store remodeling investments

### Option 3: Urban Penetration with Neighborhood Markets
**Pros**:
- Underserved market opportunity
- Leverages grocery strength
- Smaller format requires less capital per store
- 5.5% same-store sales growth in existing Neighborhood Markets
- Testing ground for new services

**Cons**:
- Intense competition in urban markets
- Higher labor costs in urban areas
- Only 683 stores after 20+ years (slow growth)
- Smaller stores = lower sales per location

### Recommended Action
> **Prioritize E-commerce with selective urban expansion.** E-commerce is existential - Walmart must defend against Amazon while leveraging its unique assets (stores as fulfillment centers, grocery strength). Urban Neighborhood Markets should be secondary, focusing on high-potential locations that can also serve as e-commerce hubs. Avoid broad upscaling but continue selective premium private label development.

### Implementation Plan
1. **Immediate (Q1-Q2 2022)**: Accelerate Walmart+ member acquisition through pricing/benefits improvements
2. **Short-term (2022)**: Expand fulfillment center network and last-mile delivery capabilities
3. **Medium-term (2023)**: Integrate Neighborhood Markets as urban fulfillment hubs
4. **Long-term (2024+)**: Achieve e-commerce profitability through scale and operational efficiency
5. **Continuous**: Invest in technology and talent to close gap with Amazon

## Personal Reflections

### Key Learnings
1. Competitive advantage can erode even for dominant players if they don't adapt to changing market conditions
2. Multiple strategic options can be viable, but resource constraints force prioritization
3. Legacy strengths (physical stores) can become assets in new competitive contexts (omni-channel fulfillment)

### Applications to Future Situations
- When facing strategic choices, consider both offensive (growth) and defensive (protection) imperatives
- Brand perception is difficult to change and constrains strategic options
- Success in one dimension (low prices) can limit flexibility in others (upscaling)

### Questions for Further Research
- How can traditional retailers balance physical and digital investments?
- What determines success vs failure in upscaling attempts?
- Can Walmart achieve e-commerce profitability at scale?
