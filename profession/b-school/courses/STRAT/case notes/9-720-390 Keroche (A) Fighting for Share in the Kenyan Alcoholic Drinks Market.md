# Keroche (A): Fighting for Share in the Kenyan Alcoholic Drinks Market

## Quick Facts
- **Case #**: 9-720-390
- **Course**: [[STRAT]]
- **Class #**: 11
- **Date Read**: 2025-10-06
- **Industry**: Alcoholic Beverages
- **Geography**: Kenya, East Africa

## Executive Summary
In February 2003, Tabitha Karanja faces a critical decision after the Kenyan government raids and shuts down Keroche Industries, her company that provides safe, affordable alcoholic drinks to low-income consumers. With EABL controlling 95% of the formal market and planning to enter Keroche's segment, she must decide whether to shut down or fight allegations she believes are EABL-orchestrated.

## Case Context

### Company Background
- Founded 1997 by husband-and-wife team Tabitha and Joseph Karanja in Naivasha, Kenya
- Started with $5,000 life savings + $3,500 family loan, used home and 30 acres as collateral
- Goal: 100% Kenyan-owned company producing safe, affordable drinks for low-income/rural consumers
- Began with 5 employees producing fortified wines (8-15% alcohol) from home
- By 2003: 230 employees, 35 depots across 5 provinces, US$1.08M revenue, US$80K profit
- Total investment to date: US$1.3 million, with US$131K outstanding loans secured by company and personal assets

### Industry Landscape
- Kenya: 4th largest alcoholic drinks market in Africa (378M liters formal market, 2003)
- Market split: Formal commercial market vs. much larger informal market (dangerous traditional brews like chang'aa)
- EABL: 95%+ market share since 1922, majority-owned by British Diageo (2000), Kenya's largest taxpayer (6-7% of total taxes)
- Government taxes alcoholic drinks up to 40% of sales price
- Average EABL Tusker beer: US$0.99/500ml (unaffordable for most: GDP per capita US$437/year = $1.20/day)
- Chang'aa ("kill me quick"): US$0.13/250ml, 50% alcohol, often contaminated with methanol/jet fuel/embalming fluid
- 2000: 130 deaths, 20+ blinded, 400 hospitalized from illicit alcohol

### Timeline of Events
- 1997: Keroche founded, launches Viena fortified wine
- 1998-2002: EABL vs. SAB "Beer Wars" (SAB enters Kenya with Castle beer)
- 2002: EABL and SAB end competition, exchange market territories
- 2003: EABL announces plans to enter low-income segment
- Feb 2003: Weeks of negative press, parliamentary attacks accusing Keroche of deadly drinks
- Feb 28, 2003: Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS) raids factory, revokes all liquor licenses, shuts down operations

## Key Protagonists
- **Tabitha Karanja**: Founder & CEO of Keroche
  - Born 1964 in rural poverty, first of 10 children
  - 39 years old, mother of 4 children under age 11
  - Key decisions: Whether to shut down or fight allegations, how to respond to EABL competition

- **Joseph Karanja**: Co-founder, husband of Tabitha
  - First salesperson, traveled town-to-town building customer base
  - Involved in all aspects from production to sales

- **EABL Leadership**: Michael Karanja (Group MD, 1998), Jeremiah Kiereini (Chairman, former 30-year head of Kenya Public Service, now shareholder)

## Central Problem/Decision

### The Question
Should Tabitha Karanja (1) shut down Keroche completely, or (2) fight the government allegations and EABL competition to keep the business alive?

### Constraints
1. Outstanding loans of US$131,000 secured by company and personal assets (including family home)
2. Factory shut down, no revenue generation during fight
3. 39-year-old mother of 4 young children
4. Fighting formidable adversaries: government (KEBS), EABL (95% market share, Kenya's largest taxpayer), media, Parliament
5. Weak Kenyan judicial system (corruption, KANU elite protection, case backlogs)
6. Government support for multinationals (tax revenue, development financing)
7. EABL planning to launch low-priced beer targeting same segment

### Success Metrics
- Ability to repay outstanding loans and recoup US$1.3M investment
- Credibility and reputation preservation
- Employee, distributor, and customer welfare
- Message sent to other Kenyan entrepreneurs about local business viability

## Analysis

### Strengths
- First-mover in serving low-income formal market segment (untapped by EABL)
- 100% Kenyan-owned (patriotic appeal vs. multinational EABL)
- Strong distribution network: 35 depots across 5 provinces by 2003
- Direct marketing expertise (bar/pub owners, community events)
- Low-cost position: Viena US$0.76/750ml vs. EABL Tusker US$0.99/500ml
- Product safety differentiation vs. dangerous chang'aa
- Entrepreneurial founders with hands-on approach
- Proven revenue growth: US$740K (2000) → US$1.08M (2002)

### Weaknesses
- Small scale vs. EABL (US$1M revenue vs. US$339M)
- Limited financial resources (US$131K loans outstanding)
- Distribution still weaker than EABL's entrenched national network
- Little brand recognition in mainstream media/urban markets
- Vulnerable to being confused with illicit alcohol producers
- Personal assets at risk (home, land)
- No government support or political connections

### Opportunities
- Large underserved low-income market (79% rural population)
- Growing awareness of chang'aa dangers (130 deaths in 2000)
- Potential for public sympathy as Kenyan entrepreneur vs. multinational
- EABL's Beer Wars experience shows willingness to negotiate/exit unprofitable competition
- New government under Kibaki (2002) promised reform
- Media/PR campaign could shift public opinion

### Threats
- Government shutdown and license revocation (factory closed)
- EABL entering low-income segment with superior resources
- Corruption in judicial system favors KANU elite/EABL connections
- Parliamentary attacks, negative media coverage
- Government reliance on EABL tax revenue (6-7% of total)
- Historical pattern: Government supports multinationals over local businesses (e.g., Softa Bottling failure)
- Inability to generate revenue while shut down
- Personal financial ruin if loans default

## Discussion Questions
1. What key factors drove Keroche's success?
2. What can Tabitha learn about EABL as a competitor from its response to SAB's entry in the "Beer Wars"? Refer to the framework "Goals, Strategy, Capabilities, and Assumptions" in the Game On Module Note.
3. How should she address the government's allegations and the factory shutdown?

## My Analysis & Recommendations

### Option 1: Shut Down Keroche
**Pros**:
- Avoids costly, uncertain legal battle against formidable adversaries
- Limits personal/professional damage from prolonged fight
- Could potentially salvage some assets before complete collapse

**Cons**:
- Cannot repay US$131K loans → lose home and land
- Loses entire US$1.3M investment
- Destroys credibility/reputation amid unfounded allegations
- Abandons employees, distributors, customers
- Sends message that local businesses cannot compete vs. multinationals
- Gives EABL monopoly over low-income segment

### Option 2: Fight Allegations and EABL
**Pros**:
- Potential to clear name, restore licenses, resume operations
- Keroche has competitive advantages: local ownership, first-mover in segment, lower costs
- EABL's Beer Wars experience shows they negotiate when competition is costly
- Public sympathy possible (Kenyan entrepreneur vs. British multinational)
- New Kibaki government may be more reform-minded

**Cons**:
- Long, expensive legal battle (no revenue during shutdown)
- Corrupt judiciary favors KANU elite/EABL connections
- EABL has vastly superior resources (339x revenue)
- High personal cost (39-year-old mother of 4)
- Government depends on EABL tax revenue
- Risk total failure → lose everything anyway

### Recommended Action
**Fight using multi-pronged strategy:**
1. **Legal**: Challenge KEBS allegations in court, demand independent product testing
2. **PR Campaign**: Position as Kenyan entrepreneur vs. multinational bully, highlight product safety vs. chang'aa
3. **Political Lobbying**: Appeal to Kibaki reform agenda, highlight local job creation
4. **Community Outreach**: Mobilize distributors, customers, bar owners as advocates
5. **Financing**: Seek emergency funding from development finance institutions, diaspora investors

**Rationale**: Shutting down guarantees total loss. Fighting has uncertain odds but leverages Keroche's key competitive advantage (100% Kenyan ownership, serving neglected segment) against EABL's vulnerability (foreign-owned despite "My country, my beer" slogan, history of ruthless competition that invites scrutiny).

### Implementation Plan
1. **Week 1**: Hire lawyer, file court challenge, commission independent product testing
2. **Week 1-2**: Launch media campaign highlighting Kenyan ownership, safety vs. chang'aa, EABL's hypocrisy
3. **Week 2-4**: Lobby new Kibaki administration, frame as local entrepreneurship vs. colonial legacy
4. **Ongoing**: Mobilize grassroots support (distributors, customers, employees)
5. **Month 2-3**: Seek alternative financing to sustain fight and prepare for reopening

## Personal Reflections & Key Takeaways

### Synthesis of Learning
1. **[Competitive positioning in institutional voids]**: Keroche's success came from identifying an underserved segment (low-income consumers) neglected by the monopolist, but operating in weak institutional environments (corrupt judiciary, government favoritism toward multinationals) creates existential risk even for well-positioned competitors.
2. **[Asymmetric warfare: David vs. Goliath strategies]**: When fighting a vastly larger competitor (314x revenue), the smaller player must leverage asymmetric advantages (local ownership, agility, moral authority) rather than compete on resources. Keroche's "100% Kenyan" positioning vs. EABL's foreign ownership is a critical strategic asset.
3. **[Non-market strategy as competitive imperative]**: The case demonstrates that competitive advantage requires not just market strategy (product, price, distribution) but also non-market strategy (government relations, media management, judicial engagement). Keroche's failure to build political relationships early created catastrophic vulnerability.

### Applications to Future Situations
- Emerging market entry requires parallel investment in institutional relationships, not just operations
- First-mover advantage is fragile without barriers to entry (regulatory, resource-based, or relational)
- Competitor analysis must include non-market capabilities (government influence, media control)

### Questions for Further Research
- What was the actual outcome of Keroche's decision? Did they survive?
- How do entrepreneurs in weak institutional environments build resilience against politically-connected incumbents?
- What role did gender play in Tabitha Karanja's treatment by government/media?
