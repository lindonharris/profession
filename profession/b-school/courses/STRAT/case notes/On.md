## Introduction
### Introduction 
 
In just over a decade, On has gone from a niche Swiss startup to one of the most exciting new entrants in the global sports footwear industry. With a design-forward aesthetic, innovative cushioning technology, and a grassroots brand-building approach, On has carved out a fast-growing niche in a market long dominated by giants like Nike and adidas. The case explores how this newcomer built a strategy to compete differently—and now faces a pivotal decision about whether to disrupt the market again with a bold new product and business model.
