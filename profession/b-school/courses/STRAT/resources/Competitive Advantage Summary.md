# Competitive Advantage - Strategy Note Summary
**Note #**: N9-725-355
**Author**: Professor Jan W. Rivkin

**Course**: [[STRAT]]

## Core Definition
> **Strategy**: An integrated set of choices that positions a firm in its industry so as to create and capture superior value over the long run.

## Key Insights on Performance Variation

### Industry vs. Within-Industry Effects
- **Industry effects**: Account for only 5-15% of profitability variation
- **Within-industry effects**: Account for 30-45% of profitability variation
- **Key implication**: Being in an attractive industry isn't enough - firms must create competitive advantage within their industry

### Performance Examples (2005-2021)
- **Lilly (Pharma)**: 28% ROIC - Far exceeded industry average
- **Air Canada (Airlines)**: 2.5% ROIC - Underperformed even in tough industry
- **Lesson**: Individual firm strategy matters more than industry selection

## The Logic of Value Creation

### Added Value Framework
**Core Concept**: A firm has competitive advantage if it has driven a wider wedge between customer willingness to pay (WTP) and costs than competitors have achieved.

**Added Value Definition**: The maximal value created by all participants in a transaction minus the maximal value that could be created without the firm.
- If firm disappears, would anyone miss it?
- Can it be completely replaced?

### Value Creation Components
1. **Willingness to Pay (WTP)**: Maximum amount customer will pay
2. **Supplier Opportunity Cost**: Minimum suppliers will accept for resources
3. **Total Value Created**: WTP - Supplier Opportunity Cost
4. **Value Capture**: Limited by firm's added value

### Harnischfeger Portal Crane Example
- **Customer WTP**: $7.5M (saves $1M vs forklifts + $6.5M operating costs)
- **Production Cost**: $2.5M
- **Problem**: When Kranco entered with identical offering, Harnischfeger's added value → $0
- **Solution**: Added services that increased WTP to $9M, restoring added value

## Three Generic Strategies for Competitive Advantage

### 1. Differentiation Strategy
- Raise WTP significantly with only slight cost increases
- **Example**: On (Swiss running shoes)
  - Premium cushioning technology & aesthetics
  - Direct-to-consumer + specialty retail distribution
  - Higher costs but even higher price premium

### 2. Low-Cost Strategy
- Achieve large cost savings with minimal WTP reduction
- **Example**: Walmart
  - Negotiating power with suppliers
  - Logistics efficiency
  - No-frills stores
  - Lower WTP for some segments but greater cost advantage

### 3. Dual Advantage Strategy
- Both raise WTP AND lower costs (rare but powerful)
- **Examples**:
  - Japanese manufacturers (1970s-80s): Higher quality at lower cost through reduced defects
  - Samsung memory chips: First-mover premium + volume-based cost advantage
  - LEGO: Premium brand + operational efficiency

## Four Patterns of Advantaged Companies

### Pattern 1: Wider Wedge
Companies with advantage consistently maintain larger gap between WTP and costs than competitors
- Competitive power: Can undercut rivals on price while maintaining margins
- Example: Walmart vs Kmart scenario

### Pattern 2: Reinforcing Activities
Advantaged companies implement distinctive, reinforcing activities across all functions
- **Value Chain Tool**: Maps primary activities (inbound logistics → operations → outbound logistics → marketing/sales → service) and support activities
- **Walmart Example**:
  - Point-of-sale data → Better buying → Less clearance needed → EDLP → Less advertising → Lower labor costs
  - Rural locations + Concentric expansion + Distribution efficiency

### Pattern 3: Distinctive Value Proposition
Companies excel on attributes valued by target customers while consciously underperforming elsewhere
- **Value Map Tool**: Charts performance across multiple attributes
- **Key Insight**: Being "everything to everyone" typically fails
- **Walmart Value Proposition**:
  - **Strong**: Low prices, selection across categories
  - **Weak**: Sales help, store ambiance
  - Different from both Kmart and Mom & Pop stores

### Pattern 4: Effective Response to Competitive Forces
Advantaged companies neutralize industry forces better than rivals
- **Five Forces Application**:
  - Serve segments less exposed to forces
  - Configure to neutralize threats
  - Build switching costs and entry barriers
- **Walmart's Response**:
  - Rivalry: Low costs win price wars
  - Entry: Dominates small towns
  - Suppliers: Scale neutralizes power
  - Substitutes: Entered e-commerce and warehouse clubs

## Strategic Frameworks & Tools

### 1. Added Value Analysis
- Calculate value creation potential
- Identify sources of uniqueness
- Quantify competitive advantage

### 2. Value Chain Analysis
- Map all company activities
- Identify distinctive elements
- Find reinforcement patterns
- **Components**:
  - Primary: Inbound logistics, Operations, Outbound logistics, Marketing/Sales, Service
  - Support: Infrastructure, HR, Technology, Procurement

### 3. Value Map
- Chart performance on customer-valued attributes
- Compare to competitors
- Identify value proposition
- Shows tradeoffs and positioning

### 4. Five Forces Assessment
- Evaluate company's response to:
  - Competitive rivalry
  - Threat of entry
  - Supplier power
  - Buyer power
  - Substitutes

## Key Strategic Principles

### On Differentiation
- "Differentiated" ≠ Simply different
- Must command price premium
- Lower price ≠ Differentiation

### On Positioning
- Choose target segments carefully
- Excel where it matters to targets
- Accept underperformance elsewhere
- Stand for something distinctive

### On Activities
- Single activities rarely create advantage
- Need reinforcing system across functions
- Internal consistency critical
- Activities generate both WTP and costs

### On Value Creation
- Profit potential derives from scarcity
- Must be unique AND valuable
- Added value caps value capture potential
- No added value = No sustainable profit

## Application Guidelines

### Analyzing Competitive Advantage
1. **Define the transaction**: What are you competing to sell?
2. **Identify target segment**: Which customers?
3. **Calculate the wedge**: WTP vs costs relative to competitors
4. **Map activities**: What drives the wedge?
5. **Test consistency**: Do activities reinforce?
6. **Assess positioning**: Clear value proposition?
7. **Evaluate forces**: Effective response to industry structure?

### Creating Competitive Advantage
- **Widen the wedge** through one of three strategies
- **Build reinforcing activities** across the organization
- **Define clear value proposition** with conscious tradeoffs
- **Neutralize competitive forces** better than rivals

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. Assuming industry attractiveness is sufficient
2. Trying to be everything to everyone
3. Competing on price without cost advantage
4. Ignoring reinforcement among activities
5. Failing to make clear tradeoffs
