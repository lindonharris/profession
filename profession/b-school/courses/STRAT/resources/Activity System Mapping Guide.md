# Activity System Mapping: A Comprehensive Guide

**Course**: STRAT - Strategy
**Framework Type**: Strategic Analysis Tool
**Purpose**: Visualizing and analyzing how a firm's activities interconnect to create competitive advantage

## Executive Summary

Activity System Mapping is a powerful strategic analysis tool that visualizes how a company's choices and activities interconnect, reinforce each other, and create sustainable competitive advantage. Unlike linear frameworks, it reveals the complex web of relationships that make strategies difficult to imitate and powerful when properly aligned.

## Core Concept

An activity system map displays a company's strategic position as a network of interconnected activities, showing:
- How individual choices relate to and reinforce each other
- Where synergies and conflicts exist
- Why some strategies are more defensible than others
- How the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts

## Theoretical Foundation

### Origins and Evolution
Developed by Michael Porter as an extension of his competitive strategy work, activity system mapping addresses a critical question: Why can't successful strategies be easily copied? The answer lies not in individual activities but in their unique interconnections.

### Key Principle: Strategic Fit
Porter identified three types of fit that create competitive advantage:

#### 1. First-Order Fit: Simple Consistency
- All activities align with the overall strategic positioning
- Basic requirement for any coherent strategy
- Example: A luxury brand ensuring all touchpoints reflect premium positioning

#### 2. Second-Order Fit: Activities Reinforce Each Other
- Activities not only consistent but mutually reinforcing
- Creates positive feedback loops and virtuous cycles
- Example: IKEA's self-service model reinforces low costs, which enables low prices, which attracts volume, which justifies huge stores, which enables self-service

#### 3. Third-Order Fit: Optimization of Effort
- Coordination and information exchange across activities multiply their value
- The system becomes optimized as a whole
- Example: Zara's entire system optimized around fast fashion - from design to store placement to supply chain

## Components of an Activity System Map

### Visual Elements

#### Nodes (Activities)
- **Core Strategic Positioning**: Central node representing the firm's fundamental value proposition
- **Primary Activities**: Major strategic choices directly linked to positioning
- **Supporting Activities**: Secondary choices that enable primary activities
- **Size Variation**: Larger nodes often indicate more critical activities

#### Connections (Relationships)
- **Solid Lines**: Strong reinforcing relationships
- **Dotted Lines**: Weaker or indirect relationships
- **Red/Conflict Lines**: Tensions or tradeoffs
- **Arrows**: Directional relationships (A enables B)
- **Thickness**: Strength of the relationship

### Relationship Types

#### Reinforcing Relationships
Activities that strengthen each other, creating virtuous cycles:
```
Low Costs → Low Prices → High Volume → Economies of Scale → Lower Costs
```

#### Complementary Relationships
Activities that work better together than separately:
```
Direct Sales + Customer Education + Premium Pricing = Solution Selling
```

#### Conflicting Relationships
Activities that create tensions requiring strategic choices:
```
Broad Market Coverage ←conflict→ Deep Specialization
Low Cost ←conflict→ High Service
```

## Building an Activity System Map: Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Foundation (Identify Core Elements)

#### Step 1: Define Strategic Positioning
- What is the firm's core value proposition?
- What makes it unique in the market?
- Place this at the center of your map

#### Step 2: List Distinctive Activities
- What does the firm do differently from competitors?
- Include activities across all functions
- Focus on choices, not just competencies

#### Step 3: Categorize Activities
- Strategic themes (cost, quality, speed, innovation)
- Functional areas (operations, marketing, HR, etc.)
- Time horizon (current vs. developing)

### Phase 2: Mapping (Create Connections)

#### Step 4: Identify Direct Relationships
For each activity, ask:
- What does this enable?
- What makes this possible?
- What does this require?

#### Step 5: Find Reinforcement Loops
Look for circular patterns:
- A strengthens B, which strengthens C, which strengthens A
- These create competitive advantage momentum

#### Step 6: Spot Conflicts and Tensions
Identify where activities might:
- Require different resources
- Appeal to different customers
- Demand conflicting capabilities

### Phase 3: Analysis (Evaluate System Strength)

#### Step 7: Assess System Coherence
- **High Coherence**: Many reinforcing connections, few conflicts
- **Low Coherence**: Isolated activities, multiple tensions

#### Step 8: Evaluate Imitability
- **Hard to Imitate**: Many interconnections, unique combinations
- **Easy to Imitate**: Few connections, standard practices

#### Step 9: Identify Vulnerabilities
- Single points of failure
- Activities dependent on external factors
- Areas where competitors could attack

## Classic Examples

### Southwest Airlines: The Canonical Example

**Core Positioning**: Lowest cost air travel

**Interconnected Activities**:
```
No meals served
    ↓ (enables)
No meal service logistics
    ↓ (enables)
Faster turnaround (15 min)
    ↓ (enables)
More flights per plane
    ↓ (enables)
Lower cost per flight
    ↓ (enables)
Lower fares
    ↓ (attracts)
Price-sensitive customers
    ↓ (accept)
No meals served
```

**Key Insights**:
- Every activity reinforces the low-cost position
- Copying one element (e.g., no meals) without the system fails
- The system becomes stronger over time through learning

## Advanced Concepts

### Dynamic Activity Systems
Activity systems evolve over time through:

#### Addition
- New activities that create more connections
- Example: Amazon adding AWS, which reinforced retail

#### Subtraction
- Removing activities that no longer fit
- Example: Netflix eliminating DVD business

#### Reconfiguration
- Changing relationships between existing activities
- Example: IBM shifting from hardware to services

### Multi-Business Activity Systems
In diversified companies, look for:

#### Shared Activities
- Common resources leveraged across businesses
- Example: Disney's characters across movies, parks, products

#### Cross-Business Reinforcement
- Success in one area strengthens another
- Example: Apple's ecosystem lock-in

#### Portfolio Conflicts
- Where businesses undermine each other
- Example: Traditional vs. digital in media companies

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### Pitfall 1: Listing Activities Without Showing Relationships
**Solution**: For every activity, explicitly identify at least 2-3 connections

### Pitfall 2: Ignoring Conflicts
**Solution**: Actively look for tensions - they reveal strategic choices

### Pitfall 3: Making It Too Complex
**Solution**: Focus on 15-20 most important activities, not everything

### Pitfall 4: Static Thinking
**Solution**: Consider how the system evolved and might evolve

### Pitfall 5: Inside-Out Perspective
**Solution**: Always link back to customer value and competitive position

## Diagnostic Questions for Strong Activity Systems

### System Coherence
1. Do most activities have multiple connections?
2. Are there more reinforcing relationships than conflicts?
3. Does each activity clearly support the strategic positioning?

### Competitive Advantage
1. Would copying 1-2 activities help competitors?
2. How many activities would competitors need to copy to match our position?
3. Are the combinations of activities unique to us?

### Sustainability
1. Do the reinforcement loops get stronger over time?
2. Are we deepening the system or just adding isolated activities?
3. Where might the system break under pressure?

### Strategic Fit
1. Are we making clear tradeoffs?
2. Do our activities require similar capabilities?
3. Is there organization alignment around the system?

## Using Activity Maps for Strategic Decision-Making

### Evaluating New Initiatives
Before adding a new activity, assess:
- How many existing activities will it reinforce?
- Will it create any new conflicts?
- Does it deepen our strategic position?

### Competitive Analysis
Compare activity systems to understand:
- Why some competitors are more successful
- Where competitive advantages truly lie
- Potential moves competitors might make

### Identifying Strategic Options
Use the map to find:
- Underexploited reinforcement opportunities
- Conflicts that could be resolved
- Missing activities that would strengthen the system

### Merger & Acquisition Analysis
Evaluate targets by:
- Mapping their activity system
- Identifying potential synergies
- Spotting system conflicts

## Tools and Techniques

### Software Options
