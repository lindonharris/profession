## 🎯 Core Strategic Frameworks

### 1. Competitive Advantage Fundamentals
*Source: [Competitive Advantage - Rivkin](resources/Competitive%20Advantage%20-%20Rivkin%20HBS%20Case.pdf)*

#### The Central Equation
**Competitive Advantage = Wider wedge between Willingness to Pay (WTP) and Cost than competitors**

#### Key Concepts:
- **Added Value**: Value created with firm - Value created without firm
- **Value Creation vs Capture**: Creating value ≠ Capturing value
- **Industry Effects**: Only 5-15% of profit variation
- **Within-Industry Effects**: 30-45% of profit variation

#### Three Strategic Paths:
1. **Differentiation**: ↑↑ WTP with ↑ Cost
2. **Low-Cost**: ↓↓ Cost with ↓ WTP
3. **Dual Advantage**: ↑ WTP AND ↓ Cost (rare)

### 2. Analytical Tools Arsenal

#### Porter's Five Forces (+ Complements)
- **Purpose**: Industry attractiveness & competitive dynamics
- **Forces**: Rivalry, Suppliers, Buyers, Substitutes, New Entrants, **+ Availability of Complements**
- **Application**: Use for industry-level analysis, not firm-specific
- **Key Insight**: Even ONE bad force can drive profit out of an industry
- **Complements**: Increase demand for focal product but want their slice (e.g., Wintel in PCs, gaming platforms + game libraries)

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**
- Assuming competition comes only from direct competitors (suppliers, buyers, substitutes also compete for value)
- Paying too little attention to substitutes (they can be subtle, e.g., Zoom for air travel)
- Failing to manage complements
- Focusing on average rival/customer/supplier instead of most challenging one
- Confusing evidence of a force with its underlying cause
- Ignoring changes in structural forces over time

#### Value Chain Analysis
- **Primary Activities**: Inbound Logistics → Operations → Outbound Logistics → Marketing & Sales → Service
- **Support Activities**: Infrastructure, HR, Technology, Procurement
- **Key Insight**: Look for reinforcing activities (red lines in Walmart example)

#### Activity System Mapping
*[Activity System Guide](resources/Activity%20System%20Mapping%20Guide.md)*
- Map interconnected strategic choices
- Identify reinforcement patterns
- Spot strategic themes

#### Value Maps
- Plot competitive positioning on key attributes
- Identify "strategic groups"
- Find white space opportunities

#### Cost Concepts for Commodity Industries
**Critical for Module I understanding:**

| Cost Type | Definition | Relevant For | Decision Rule |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| **Marginal Cost** | Expenses from producing one additional unit | Change in output | Increase output if Price > MC |
| **Non-Sunk Cost (NSC)** | Costs eliminated if plant shut down | Exiting existing capacity | Continue operations if Price > Average NSC |
| **Total Cost** | NSC + Sunk costs (incl. capital charges) | Entry/capacity addition | Enter/invest if Price > Average Total Cost |

**Supply Curve Analysis:**
- Flat supply curve → Low profitability for most players (easy tech imitation, common processes)
- Steep supply curve → High profitability for efficient producers (proprietary tech, difficult to imitate)
- Equilibrium price = unit cost of marginal producer (highest-cost producer needed to meet demand)

**Price Fluctuations in Commodity Markets:**
- High sunk costs → Steep supply curve beyond current capacity → Significant price swings
- Inelastic demand + demand increase → Slightly higher quantity but MUCH higher price
- Inelastic demand + demand decrease → Slightly lower quantity and slightly lower price

### Module II: Competitive Advantage

#### 📐 Understanding the Value Bar
**The Foundation of Competitive Advantage Analysis:**

```
WTP (Willingness to Pay) ←  Customer maximum price
    ↓
P (Price)                ←  What customer actually pays
    ↓
C (Cost)                 ←  Cost of producing product
```

- **Customer Surplus**: WTP - P (value customer keeps)
- **Margin Captured by Firm**: P - C (value firm captures)
- **Net Value Created**: WTP - C (total value pie)
- **Competitive Advantage**: Wider wedge between WTP and Cost than rivals

**Three Paths to Wider Wedge:**
1. **Differentiation**: ↑↑ WTP with ↑ Cost (On, ROH, Hilti)
2. **Low-Cost**: ↓↓ Cost with ↓ WTP (Walmart, Hurtigruten)
3. **Dual Advantage**: ↑ WTP AND ↓ Cost (rare but powerful)

**Key Insight**: Advantage is SEGMENT-SPECIFIC. Different companies can have advantages in different segments (Walmart vs. Target example).

## 🔍 Cross-Case Patterns & Insights

### Pattern 1: Reinforcement is Key
- **Walmart**: Every activity reinforces EDLP
- **On**: Premium tech → Premium price → Premium retail → Premium brand
- **Cola Wars**: Brand investment → Premium pricing → Marketing funds → Brand investment

### Pattern 2: Strategic Trade-offs Create Barriers
- Companies that try to be "everything to everyone" fail
- Clear choices on what NOT to do are as important as what TO do
- Examples: Walmart (no frills), On (no discount channel), Opera (no populist programming)

### Pattern 3: Industry Structure Shapes Strategy Options
- **Commodities** (Aluminum): Cost position is everything
- **Branded Goods** (Cola): Marketing and distribution matter most
- **Platforms** (AI): Network effects and ecosystems win
