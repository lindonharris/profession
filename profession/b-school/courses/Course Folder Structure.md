# Standard Course Folder Structure

## Directory Structure Template

Each course folder should follow this structure:

```
[COURSE CODE] - [Course Name]/
├── Professor [Name].md           # Professor info, teaching team, office hours
├── [Course] Syllabus.md         # Comprehensive syllabus document
├── Case Notes/                  # Individual case preparation notes
│   └── [Case Name].md
├── Module Notes/                 # Module-specific notes and frameworks
│   └── [Module Name].md
└── [Original PDFs/Documents]    # Any downloaded course materials
```

## Organization Principles

1. **Keep it flat** - Avoid deep nesting of folders
2. **One source of truth** - Syllabus contains all logistics
3. **Professor file is people-focused** - All human contacts in one place
4. **Notes are work product** - Separate folders for actual coursework
5. **Preserve originals** - Keep downloaded PDFs in root folder
