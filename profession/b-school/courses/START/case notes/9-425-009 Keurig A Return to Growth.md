# Keurig: A Return to Growth

## Quick Facts
- **Case #**: 9-425-009
- **Course**: [[START]] (Orientation Week - Ungraded)
- **Date Read**: 2025-09-01
- **Industry**: Consumer Goods / Coffee
- **Geography**: North America

## Executive Summary
> After JAB's acquisition in 2016, CEO Bob Gamgort led Keurig's successful turnaround. By 2017, with revenue reaching $4.8B, the company faced four strategic growth options: IPO, global expansion, merger with another coffee company, or diversification beyond coffee.

## Case Context

### Company Background
- Founded 1992 in Boston area, emerged from idea to solve office coffee problem
- Pioneered single-serve K-Cup pods, creating entirely new coffee category
- 2006: Acquired by Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (GMCR) for $104.3M
- 2016: Taken private by JAB Holding for $13.9B
- Key innovation: K-Cup patent expired 2012, opening market to competition

### Industry Landscape
- Coffee pods grew from 1% to 25% market share (2012-2015)
- 75% of cups sold as brewers/machines
- Market dominated by partnerships: Starbucks, Dunkin', McDonald's brands
- Environmental backlash: "Kill the K-Cup" movement due to pod waste
- Cold brew emerging as major growth category ($110M in 2017)

### Timeline of Events
- 2009: K-Cup growth explodes with Walmart deal
- 2012: Patent expiration, competitors enter
- 2014: Keurig 2.0 launch fails (DRM controversy)
- 2015: Keurig Kold flops ($370 price, poor performance)
- 2016: JAB acquisition for $13.9B
- 2017: Turnaround complete, evaluating growth options

## Key Protagonists
- **Bob Gamgort**: CEO (former Pinnacle Foods CEO)
  - Background: Mars executive, IPO experience
  - Key decisions: Price reductions, partner reconciliation
  - Quote: "Saturation everywhere, seemingly"

- **Olivier Goudet**: JAB Managing Partner
  - Background: Former Mars CFO
  - Led acquisition effort since 2012
  - Philosophy: "KGM was the crown jewel that had lost its way"

## Central Problem/Decision

### The Question
> **Which strategic growth option?**
> 1. IPO - Return to public markets
> 2. Global expansion - Growing international presence
> 3. Coffee merger - Acquire/merge with coffee company
> 4. Diversification - Expand beyond coffee (Dr Pepper merger)

### Constraints
1. Market saturation concerns - 50M households reached
2. Environmental criticism ongoing
3. Competition from expired patents
4. Need for growth to justify JAB investment
5. Consumer preference shifts to cold brew

### Success Metrics

2. **What criteria is most important?** 

## My Analysis & Recommendations (Your Black Ink Notes)

### Strategic Options Assessment

#### IPO 2.0: Going Public Again
**Your notes**: "easy return to JAB shareholders", "doubt mgmt is that long"
- **Pros**: Clean exit for JAB, proven model
- **Cons**: Control issues, short-term pressure

#### Global Expansion

- Focus on South Korea opening opportunities
- Cultural coffee preferences differ by region

#### Coffee Industry Consolidation  
**Your notes**: "flat sales, dip in market"
- Market showing maturity signs
- Consolidation could provide scale

#### Diversification (Dr Pepper)
**Your notes**: "con: but cold brew didn't work", "Could JAB separate entities w/in conglomerate"
- Previous cold attempts failed
- Questions about execution capability

### Your Pre-Class Analysis Points
- **Keurig 2.0 flopped** - DRM/environmental criticism major issue
- **Patent expiration → market share erosion, price elasticity**
- **Walmart = key** (25% brewers, 75% cups distribution)
- **KGM x Starbucks** and **KGM x Peet's** partnerships crucial
- **"Kill the K-Cup"** movement serious threat
- **Fuego creep → strategy creep** concern

### Recommended Action
> Based on your analysis emphasis on partnerships and distribution, the Dr Pepper diversification appears most viable, leveraging existing DSD network while avoiding direct coffee market saturation.
