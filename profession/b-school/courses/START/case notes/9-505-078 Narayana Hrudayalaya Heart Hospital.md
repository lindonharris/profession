# Narayana Hrudayalaya Heart Hospital: Cardiac Care for the Poor (A)

## Quick Facts
- **Case #**: 9-505-078
- **Course**: [[START]] (Orientation Week - Ungraded)
- **Date Read**: 2025-09-02
- **Industry**: Healthcare
- **Geography**: Bangalore, India

## Executive Summary
> Dr. Devi Shetty founded Narayana Hrudayalaya (NH) in 2001 to provide high-quality cardiac care at radically low costs in India. By 2004, NH had grown to 500 beds performing 19 open-heart surgeries daily at 60% of typical costs, using cross-subsidization where paying patients fund care for the poor.

## Case Context

### Company Background
- Founded 2001 by Dr. Devi Shetty in Bangalore
- Name means "God's Compassionate Home" in Sanskrit
- Started with construction backing from father-in-law (Shankaranarayana, founder of SNC construction)
- Grown from initial setup to 500 beds by 2004, planning 800 beds and 20,000 surgeries/year
- Phase I complete, Phase II underway with plans for over 100 acres of facilities

### Industry Landscape
- India: 1.03 billion population (2003), with only 0.5 physicians per 1,000 people
- 2.4 million people need heart surgery yearly, but only 60,000 surgeries performed
- Healthcare spending only 1% of GDP (vs 6.3% Asian average)
- Private healthcare dominant but expensive - OHS costs Rs. 250,000 at private hospitals
- 85% of Indian population lacks health insurance

### Timeline of Events
- 2001: NH founded in Bangalore
- 2001-2004: Internal growth, expanded to 500 beds
- 2002: Yeshasvini insurance scheme launched for 1.7M farmers
- 2004: 90 cardiac surgeons, performing 4,276 surgeries, 5,430 catheterizations
- 2004: Started bone marrow transplant unit (Emami National Institute)
- 2005: Planning to offer India's first diploma in cardiology

## Key Protagonists
- **Dr. Devi Prasad Shetty**: Founder & Chairman
  - Background: Trained at Guy's Hospital London, worked with Mother Teresa
  - Personal cardiac surgeon to Mother Teresa
  - Vision: "Wal-Martization of healthcare"
  - Philosophy: Healthcare as fundamental right, not luxury

## Central Problem/Decision

### The Question
> How should Dr. Shetty expand NH's impact - through IPO, international expansion, merger with coffee company, or "pure-play beverage" strategy with Dr Pepper Snapple?

### Constraints
1. Limited access to capital for expansion
2. Need to maintain quality while scaling
3. Balance between profitability and social mission
4. Infrastructure limitations in India
5. Shortage of trained medical personnel

### Success Metrics
- Volume of procedures (target: 20,000 surgeries/year)
- Cost per procedure (maintaining 60% of standard costs)
- Mortality rates (1.27% vs 1.2% in US)
- Financial sustainability
- Number of poor patients served

## Analysis

### Strengths
- Operational efficiency: 19 OHS/day vs 2.5 US average
- Cost structure: Rs. 90,000 ($2,000) break-even for adult OHS
- Strong leadership with clear vision
- Innovative financing models (cross-subsidization, insurance)
- High volume creating learning curve advantages
- Daily financial transparency and monitoring

### Weaknesses
- Dependence on single location
- Limited trained personnel pipeline
- Infrastructure constraints
- Low fixed salaries may affect retention

### Opportunities
- Massive unmet demand (2.4M need surgery, only 60K performed)
- Telemedicine expansion potential
- Health City concept replication
- Insurance scheme scaling (Yeshasvini model)
- Medical tourism (150,000 foreign patients in 2003)

### Threats
- Competition from established private hospitals
- Regulatory changes
- Dependence on equipment suppliers
- Economic downturns affecting paying patients

## Financial Analysis
| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Break-even OHS (Adult) | Rs. 90,000 ($2,000) | vs $20,000 US |
| Break-even OHS (Child) | Rs. 130,000 ($2,900) | Higher complexity |
| Average procedure cost | 60% of standard | Through efficiency |
| Doctor salaries | 22% of revenue | Fixed, not percentage |
| Daily procedures | 19 OHS, 25 cath | 8x Indian average |
| Paying patient % | 30-40% | Subsidizes others |

## Key Exhibits
- Exhibit 4: Price comparison showing NH at 36-64% of competitors
- Exhibit 8: Volume growth from 1,642 surgeries (2001-02) to 3,570 (2003-04)
- Exhibit 10: Balance sheet showing Rs. 387M in assets
- Exhibit 11: Income statement showing Rs. 35M profit (2004)
- Exhibit 12: Revenue mix - paying vs subsidized patients

## Discussion Questions
1. Is Dr. Shetty better described as a "savvy business leader" or "philanthropist"?
2. How is NH able to deliver high-quality open heart surgery at such low cost?
3. How does NH make money? How can they subsidize patients who can't pay?
4. How would you advise Dr. Shetty as he looks to expand NH's impact?

## My Analysis & Recommendations
> *[BLACK INK ANNOTATIONS - Pre-class preparation to be extracted from marked PDF]*

### Option 1: IPO and Public Markets
**Pros**: Access to capital, liquidity for expansion, public accountability
**Cons**: Pressure for profits may compromise social mission, quarterly reporting burden

### Option 2: International Expansion
**Pros**: Leverage expertise globally, increase scale, medical tourism
**Cons**: Different regulatory environments, capital intensive, management complexity

### Option 3: Domestic Merger/Consolidation
**Pros**: Immediate scale, shared resources, market power
**Cons**: Cultural integration challenges, mission alignment issues

### Option 4: Health City Ecosystem
**Pros**: Comprehensive care model, shared infrastructure, specialty focus
**Cons**: Large capital requirement, execution complexity

### Recommended Action
> Build the Health City model domestically first, proving the comprehensive care ecosystem before international expansion. Use hybrid financing combining social investment, government partnerships, and selective private equity.

### Implementation Plan
1. Complete Phase II expansion to 800 beds
2. Launch cardiology diploma program to address talent shortage
3. Expand telemedicine network to 20+ CCUs
4. Replicate Yeshasvini insurance model in 3 more states
5. Build 2-3 specialty units leveraging shared infrastructure
6. Document and standardize operational protocols for replication
