## Central Problem/Decision

### The Question
1. How should Heinz record the acquisition of Kraft at transaction completion? How does it affect the balance sheet?
2. How would the balance sheet impact differ if Heinz purchased only a minority interest in Kraft?
3. As an analyst, what questions would you have about identifiable intangibles (trademarks, customer relationships) and goodwill?
4. How should Kraft Heinz record Q4 write-down of goodwill and identifiable intangibles? What's the cash flow impact?
5. What questions would you have about the write-down? Why did the stock market react so negatively?

### Constraints
1. U.S. GAAP acquisition method requirements
2. Fair value measurement challenges for intangible assets
3. Berkshire Hathaway 26.8% ownership requires equity method accounting
4. Heinz deemed acquirer (>50% control via Berkshire + 3G)
5. Need to categorize and value all identifiable tangible and intangible assets
6. Goodwill measurement as residual

### Success Metrics
- Accurate fair value measurements for purchase price allocation
- Proper classification of identifiable vs. non-identifiable intangibles
- Appropriate impairment testing and timely recognition
- Clear disclosure for investor understanding
- Alignment with operational performance

## Analysis

### Strengths (Merger & Accounting)
- Combined iconic brands (Heinz ketchup + Oscar Mayer hot dogs synergy)
- 8 brands >$1B revenue, 5 brands $500M-$1B
- International distribution network for brand expansion
- Proven 3G operational formula (zero-based budgeting, talent promotion)
- Acquisition method provides fair value reset of balance sheet
- Berkshire Hathaway's patient capital and long-term orientation

### Weaknesses (Merger & Accounting)
- Massive identifiable intangibles ($49.7B) and goodwill ($29B) on balance sheet
- Fair value measurements highly subjective for intangibles
- Future impairment risk if performance doesn't meet projections
- Integration challenges with 20% workforce cuts
- Debt-financed special dividend increases leverage
- Goodwill not amortized (only tested for impairment)

### Opportunities
- >$1.5B annual cost savings projected
- International expansion of Kraft brands via Heinz distribution
- Zero-based budgeting to reduce costs
- Marketing synergies between complementary brands
- Manufacturing and distribution rationalization

### Threats
- Changing consumer preferences (health trends away from processed foods)
- Brand value erosion requiring impairment charges
- Integration execution risk
- Overpayment reflected in high goodwill
- Future impairment signals overpayment or deteriorating performance
- Stock market reaction to impairments (loss of investor confidence)

## Discussion Questions
1. How would Heinz record the acquisition of Kraft at the date the transaction was completed? How would it have affected its financial balance sheet?

2. How would the impact in Heinz's balance sheet have differed if Heinz had purchased only a minority interest in Kraft?

3. As an analyst covering Kraft Heinz, what questions would you have about the identifiable intangible assets (trademarks and customer relationships) and goodwill recorded as a result of the merger?

4. How would Kraft Heinz record the fourth quarter write-down of goodwill and identifiable intangibles. What impact would the write-down have on Kraft Heinz's cash flow statement? (note: there is no tax impact)

5. As an analyst covering Kraft Heinz, what questions would you have about the write-down? Why do you think the stock market reacted so negatively to the news?

## My Analysis & Recommendations

### Question 1: Acquisition Recording

**Purchase Price Allocation**:
1. **Measure consideration**:
   - Fair value of Kraft Heinz shares issued to Kraft shareholders (49%)
   - Cash paid in special dividend: $9.8B

2. **Identify and value acquired assets/liabilities at fair value**:
   - Tangible assets (PP&E, inventory, receivables)
   - Identifiable intangible assets: $49.7B (trademarks, customer relationships)
   - Liabilities assumed

3. **Calculate goodwill (residual)**:
   - Goodwill = Purchase price - (Fair value of identifiable net assets)
   - Recognized: $29B

**Journal Entry (simplified)**:
```
DR: Tangible Assets (fair value)
DR: Identifiable Intangible Assets $49.7B
DR: Goodwill $29B
  CR: Liabilities Assumed (fair value)
  CR: Cash (special dividend) $9.8B
  CR: Equity (shares issued to Kraft shareholders)
```

**Balance Sheet Impact**:
- Massive increase in intangible assets ($49.7B + $29B = $78.7B)
- Reduction in cash ($9.8B special dividend)
- Increase in equity (shares issued)
- Assets recorded at fair value (step-up from historical cost)

### Question 2: Minority Interest Scenario

If Heinz purchased <50% of Kraft:
- **No consolidation** of Kraft's financial statements
- **Equity method accounting** instead (like Berkshire's treatment of Heinz pre-merger)
- Balance sheet impact:
  - Single line item: "Investment in Kraft" at cost
  - Adjusted each period for proportionate share of Kraft's earnings
  - No goodwill or intangibles separately recognized on Heinz balance sheet
  - No consolidation of Kraft's assets/liabilities
- Much simpler, cleaner balance sheet
- Less transparency into underlying intangible values

### Question 3: Analyst Questions on Intangibles

**Identifiable Intangibles ($49.7B)**:
1. What valuation methods were used for trademarks and customer relationships?
2. What assumptions drove the fair value estimates (royalty rates, customer attrition, discount rates)?
3. What are the estimated useful lives for amortization?
4. How were trademarks separated from goodwill (brand-specific vs. company-wide value)?
5. What percentage of purchase price went to identifiable intangibles vs. goodwill?
6. How do these valuations compare to peers' M&A transactions?

**Goodwill ($29B)**:
1. Why is goodwill so high (what synergies justify it)?
2. How is goodwill allocated across reporting units?
3. What are the key assumptions in impairment testing?
4. How sensitive are fair value estimates to changes in assumptions?
5. What is the track record of management's prior acquisitions (overpayment history)?
6. What portion represents overpayment vs. legitimate synergies?

### Question 4: Write-Down Accounting

**Journal Entry (Q4 2018)**:
```
DR: Impairment Loss (income statement expense)
  CR: Goodwill (reduce carrying value)
  CR: Identifiable Intangible Assets (reduce carrying value)
```

**Cash Flow Statement Impact**:
- **No impact** on cash flow from operations (non-cash charge)
- Impairment loss is added back in operating activities section
- Similar to depreciation/amortization treatment
- **Key insight**: Impairments are accounting recognition of prior economic reality, not current cash outflows

### Question 5: Write-Down Analysis & Market Reaction

**Questions About Write-Down**:
1. What triggered the impairment test (annual test or triggering event)?
2. Which brands/reporting units were impaired?
3. What changed since acquisition (market conditions, brand performance, strategy)?
4. Were original valuations too optimistic or has business deteriorated?
5. Are there more impairments coming?
6. What does this say about management's capital allocation decisions?
7. How does this compare to management's original synergy projections?

**Why Negative Market Reaction**:
1. **Signal of overpayment**: Suggests Heinz paid too much for Kraft
2. **Deteriorating fundamentals**: Brand values declining indicates business struggles
3. **Management credibility**: Questions original acquisition thesis and projections
4. **Future performance concerns**: If brands underperforming, future earnings at risk
5. **More shoes to drop**: Investors fear additional impairments ahead
6. **Lost value**: Shareholder value destruction (purchased assets now worth less)
7. **Strategic misstep**: Questions 3G's value-creation formula in this context

**Stock market cares because**:
- Impairments suggest acquisition destroyed (not created) value
- Future earnings may disappoint if brands weakening
- Management judgment questioned
- Balance sheet weaker (less asset coverage)

## Class Discussion Notes
> [To be filled during/after class discussion]

### My Participation
- **Times Spoken**: 0
- **Cold Called**: No

### Key Insights from Discussion
- **Negative goodwill**: When acquisition price is below book value, record "negative goodwill" (gain on bargain purchase)
- **Identifiable intangibles examples**:
  - Trademarks and brands
  - Contracted relationships with suppliers and customers
  - Patents
  - Customer data and CRMs
  - Customer relationships
  - Technology/IP

### Alternative Perspectives
-

### Professor's Takeaways
- Acquisition below book value creates negative goodwill (bargain purchase gain)
- Identifiable intangibles must be separately valued before calculating goodwill residual
- Common identifiable intangibles: trademarks, brands, customer/supplier contracts, patents, CRM data
