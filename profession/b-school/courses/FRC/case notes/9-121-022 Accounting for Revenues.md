- **Course**: [[FRC]]
- **Class #**: 5
- **Date Read**: 2025-10-05
- **Industry**: Airlines, Consumer Goods, Footwear
- **Geography**: United States

## Executive Summary
In March 2020, experienced analyst Alessandra Morales prepared an overview on revenue accounting for new research analysts. She selected three mini-cases illustrating areas where management exercises judgment in revenue reporting: (1) Southwest Airlines' allocation of ticket prices between current and deferred revenue for frequent flyer programs, (2) Purple's estimation of customer return allowances for mattresses with 100-night trial periods, and (3) Crocs' estimation of bad debt expense for accounts receivable after distributor defaults in China.

## Case Context

## Key Protagonists
- **Alessandra Morales**: Experienced analyst at large U.S. brokerage firm
  - Key decisions: Select illustrative cases for revenue accounting training
  - Focus: Areas of management judgment in revenue recognition

## Central Problem/Decision

### The Question
**Southwest Airlines**:
1. How does Southwest account for its frequent flyer program? Does this make sense?
2. In 2020, what was the value of tickets issued to paying customers? What percentage was deferred? How significant are program costs?

**Purple**:
1. How is Purple required to account for risk of customer returns at end of each quarter?
2. What is objective of this accounting vs. recording expense when customers actually return mattresses?
3. Is the sales return expense significant for Purple?

**Crocs**:
1. How does Crocs account for risk of customer defaults on accounts receivable?
2. What was bad debt expense in 2015?
3. Assume in 2017 management anticipated resolution of China receivables problems and forecasted allowance as % of gross receivables would match 2014. What would be bad debt expense for 2017?

### Constraints
1. U.S. GAAP revenue recognition standards (ASC 606)
2. Management must estimate future events (returns, redemptions, collections)
3. Estimates based on historical patterns and current information
4. Need for reliable, comparable financial reporting
5. Potential for earnings management through estimates

### Success Metrics
- Accurate revenue recognition matching economic substance
- Reliable estimates based on historical experience
- Transparent disclosure for investor understanding
- Appropriate matching of revenues and expenses
- Compliance with ASC 606 requirements

## Analysis

### Mini-Case 1: Southwest Airlines - Deferred Revenue

**How Southwest accounts for Rapid Rewards**:

1. **When customer purchases ticket and earns miles**:
   - Allocate transaction price between two performance obligations:
     - **Current flight** (recognized when flown): Relative standalone selling price
     - **Future free flight** (deferred): Fair value based on historical redemption patterns
   - Deferred portion recorded as "air traffic liability" on balance sheet

2. **When customer redeems miles**:
   - DR: Air traffic liability
   - CR: Passenger revenue (if travel) or Other revenue (if non-travel goods/services)

**Does this make sense?**:
- **Yes**: Aligns with ASC 606 performance obligation framework
- Customer receives two distinct benefits: current flight + future free flight
- Deferring portion of revenue matches when company satisfies obligation
- Fair value allocation based on historical redemption is reasonable

**Calculation - Value of tickets issued in 2020**:

| Item | Amount ($M) | Calculation/Source |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| Passenger revenue recognized (current flights) | $7,665 | Given |
| Plus: Amounts deferred (future flights) | $2,125 | Exhibit 1 |
| **Total value of tickets issued to paying customers** | **$9,790** | $7,665 + $2,125 |

**Percentage deferred**:
- $2,125 / $9,790 = **21.7% deferred**

**Significance of program costs**:
- Amounts deferred ($2,125M) represent significant obligation
- Ending liability balance ($4,447M) is large relative to annual passenger revenue
- In normal year (2019): $2,941M deferred from $23,717M total tickets = **12.4%**
- 2020 percentage higher (21.7%) due to COVID reducing current travel revenue
- Program creates substantial future obligations that must be fulfilled

### Mini-Case 2: Purple - Sales Return Allowances

**How Purple accounts for customer returns**:

1. **At time of sale**:
   - Estimate percentage of sales that will be returned (based on historical experience)
   - DR: Sales returns expense (contra-revenue)
   - CR: Accrued sales returns (liability)
   - Record net sales = Gross sales - Estimated returns

2. **When customers actually return mattresses**:
   - DR: Accrued sales returns (reduce liability)
   - CR: Cash (refund to customer)
   - No adjustment to cost of sales since returned mattresses discarded

3. **Period-end true-up**:
   - Adjust accrued sales returns liability based on updated estimates

**Objective vs. recording expense when returns occur**:

**Accrual accounting objective (current method)**:
- Match revenues with period when sale occurs (not when return happens)
- More accurate representation of net revenue earned in period
- Allows for better comparability across periods
- Provides balance sheet liability for future cash outflows

**Cash basis alternative (when returns occur)**:
- Would overstate revenue in sale period
- Would understate revenue in return period
- Poor matching of revenues and expenses
- Misleading period-over-period comparisons

**Calculation - Is sales return expense significant?**:

**2018 Analysis**:
| Metric | Amount ($000s) | Calculation |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Annual sales, net | $285,791 | Given |
| Additions to returns (reduces net sales) | $33,543 | Given |
| **Gross sales (before return allowance)** | **$319,334** | $285,791 + $33,543 |
| **Return rate** | **10.5%** | $33,543 / $319,334 |

**2017 Analysis**:
| Metric | Amount ($000s) | Calculation |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Annual sales, net | $196,859 | Given |
| Additions to returns | $19,779 | Given |
| Gross sales | $216,638 | $196,859 + $19,779 |
| Return rate | **9.1%** | $19,779 / $216,638 |

**2016 Analysis**:
| Metric | Amount ($000s) | Calculation |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Annual sales, net | $65,473 | Given |
| Additions to returns | $7,278 | Given |
| Gross sales | $72,751 | $65,473 + $7,278 |
| Return rate | **10.0%** | $7,278 / $72,751 |

**Significance**:
- **YES, highly significant**: 9-10.5% of gross sales returned
- $33.5M in return allowances in 2018 (11.7% of net sales)
- Growing in absolute dollars as company scales
- Accrued liability grew from $2M (2016) → $5.5M (2018)
- Gross profit margin ~39% means returns cost ~39% x $33.5M = $13M in lost contribution

### Mini-Case 3: Crocs - Bad Debt Expense

**How Crocs accounts for customer defaults**:

1. **Allowance method** (accrual basis):
   - Estimate percentage of receivables that won't be collected
   - DR: Bad debt expense (income statement)
   - CR: Allowance for doubtful accounts (contra-asset)
   - Report net receivables = Gross receivables - Allowance

2. **When specific accounts written off**:
   - DR: Allowance for doubtful accounts
   - CR: Accounts receivable (gross)
   - No income statement impact (already expensed when estimated)

3. **Period-end adjustment**:
   - Analyze aging of receivables
   - Update allowance estimate based on current conditions
   - Record adjustment to bad debt expense

**Calculation - Bad debt expense for 2015**:

| Item | Amount ($M) | Source/Calculation |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| Allowance, beginning (Dec 31, 2014) | $13.6 | Exhibit 4 |
| Plus: Bad debt expense (2015) | **?** | To be calculated |
| Less: Write-offs (2015) | ($3.5) | Exhibit 4 |
| Allowance, ending (Dec 31, 2015) | $36.4 | Exhibit 4 |

**Formula**: Beginning + Expense - Write-offs = Ending
- $13.6 + Expense - $3.5 = $36.4
- **Bad debt expense (2015) = $26.3M**

**Verification**:
- Operating earnings before bad debt: ($46.1M)
- Operating earnings after bad debt would be: ($46.1) - $26.3 = **($72.4M)**
- This represents massive hit from China distributor defaults

**Calculation - 2017 Bad debt expense assuming 2014 % of gross receivables**:

**Step 1: Calculate 2014 allowance as % of gross receivables**:
- 2014 Allowance: $13.6M
- 2014 Gross receivables: $114.8M
- **2014 percentage: $13.6 / $114.8 = 11.8%**

**Step 2: Calculate target 2017 allowance**:
- 2017 Gross receivables: $101.8M
- Target allowance: $101.8 × 11.8% = **$12.0M**

**Step 3: Calculate required bad debt expense**:
| Item | Amount ($M) | Calculation |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Allowance, beginning (Dec 31, 2016) | $32.9 | Exhibit 4 |
| Plus: Bad debt expense (2017) | **?** | To solve |
| Less: Write-offs (2017) | ($15.8) | Exhibit 4 |
| Allowance, ending target (Dec 31, 2017) | $12.0 | Target from Step 2 |

**Formula**: $32.9 + Expense - $15.8 = $12.0
- **Bad debt expense (2017) = ($4.9M)**
- **NEGATIVE expense = Bad debt recovery/reversal**

**Interpretation**:
- This would be a **credit** to bad debt expense (benefit to income)
- Represents reversal of previous over-accrual
- Operating earnings impact: $18.5M + $4.9M = **$23.4M** (vs. actual not shown)
- Makes sense: China crisis resolved, reverting to normal collection patterns

## Discussion Questions

**Southwest Airlines**:
1. How does Southwest Airlines (SWA) account for its frequent flyer program? Does this accounting make sense to you?
2. In 2020, Southwest recognized passenger revenues of $7,665m. What was the value of tickets SWA issued to paying customers in 2020? What was the percentage of tickets issued to paying customers deferred that year? Given your answer, how significant are the costs of the program?

**Purple**:
1. How is Purple required to account for the risk of customer returns at the end of each quarter?
2. What is the objective of this accounting versus recording an expense when customers actually return mattresses?
3. Is the sales return expense significant for Purple?

**Crocs**:
1. How does Crocs account for the risk of customer defaults on accounts receivable?
2. What was the bad debt expense in 2015?
3. Assume that in 2017 Croc's management anticipated the resolution of the company's recent problems with Chinese receivables and forecasted that the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross receivables would be the same as in 2014. What would be the bad debt expense for 2017?

## My Analysis & Recommendations

### Key Accounting Concepts Illustrated

**1. Revenue Recognition - Multiple Performance Obligations (Southwest)**:
- ASC 606 requires allocation of transaction price across distinct performance obligations
- Current flight + Future free flight = Two separate obligations
- Fair value allocation based on standalone selling prices
- Deferral mechanism ensures revenue recognized when earned

**2. Sales Return Allowances (Purple)**:
- Contra-revenue account reduces gross sales to net realizable value
- Matching principle: Expense recognized in same period as sale
- Requires estimate based on historical experience
- Liability represents future cash outflow obligation
- More accurate than waiting for actual returns

**3. Bad Debt Expense - Allowance Method (Crocs)**:
- Contra-asset account reduces A/R to net realizable value
- Matching principle: Expense recognized when revenue earned, not when write-off occurs
- Requires estimate of uncollectible amounts
- Can be manipulated through aggressive/conservative estimates
- Large changes signal business problems or estimate adjustments

### Management Judgment & Earnings Management Risks

**Areas of discretion**:
1. **Southwest**: Allocation percentage between current/future obligations
2. **Purple**: Estimated return rate (could be conservative or aggressive)
3. **Crocs**: Estimated uncollectible percentage

**Red flags for earnings management**:
- Sudden changes in estimates without business reason
- Estimates consistently differ from actual results
- Allowances/reserves declining while business deteriorates
- Reversals of previous accruals to smooth earnings

**Investor considerations**:
- Compare estimates to actual outcomes over time
- Compare allowance percentages to industry peers
- Analyze trends in accruals relative to revenue/receivables
- Question large adjustments or reversals
