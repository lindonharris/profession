## Central Problem/Decision

### The Question
> What explains the $15,969 cost difference between Springfield Hospital ($17,060) and The Institute for Heart Health ($1,091) for CABG surgeries, and what actions should Grainger and Turner take to reduce the adverse cost differential while maintaining quality?

### Constraints
1. **Quality Parity**: All three hospitals have 3-star STS ratings (similar outcomes)
2. **Price Differences**: TIHH operates in emerging market with much lower labor/facility costs
3. **Volume Differences**: TIHH performs 15.4x more CABGs than Springfield (3,240 vs 210)
4. **Resource Utilization**: TIHH uses MORE minutes of labor and PP&E than Springfield
5. **Springfield's Reputation**: Known as operational excellence leader ("Toyota Hospital")
6. **Capacity Utilization**: Different availability rates across resources (72%-100%)
7. **Comparison Methodology**: TDABC used to ensure consistent cost comparison

### Success Metrics
- Identify specific cost drivers causing differences
- Quantify variance contributions (price vs efficiency vs volume)
- Develop actionable improvement recommendations
- Maintain or improve quality outcomes (STS ratings)
- Learn from PMCC's higher patient satisfaction (5 stars vs 3 stars)
- Preserve Springfield's reputation for operational excellence

## Analysis

### Strengths
- **Springfield's Operational Excellence**: Systematic approach to efficiency and continuous improvement
- **Consistent Quality**: All three hospitals achieve 3-star STS quality ratings
- **Standardized Procedure**: CABG is well-established, making comparisons meaningful
- **TDABC Methodology**: Uniform costing approach enables apples-to-apples comparison
- **Low-Risk Patient Selection**: Study restricted to uncomplicated, multi-vessel CABG cases
- **TIHH's Volume Advantage**: Production-line processes enable economies of scale
- **PMCC's Patient-Centric Model**: 5-star HCAHPS rating demonstrates superior patient experience

### Weaknesses
- **Springfield's Cost Position**: Not the lowest despite "Toyota Hospital" reputation
- **Price Differential Rationalization**: Initial tendency to attribute all differences to input prices
- **Capacity Utilization**: Springfield's resources not at full capacity (availability varies 65%-90%)
- **Patient Satisfaction Gap**: Springfield 3 stars vs PMCC 5 stars despite lower average minutes
- **Volume Constraints**: Springfield's low volume (210) limits economies of scale

- **Geographic Cost Constraints**: US labor and facility costs inherently higher than emerging markets
- **Volume Limitations**: Unlikely to achieve TIHH's 3,240 annual volume
- **Overhead Allocation**: Study excluded overhead - may reveal additional cost issues
- **Continuous Improvement Culture**: May be process-focused rather than outcome-focused

## Financial Analysis

### Total CABG Direct Costs Comparison

| Cost Category | Springfield | PMCC | TIHH | SH vs TIHH Difference |
|---------------|-------------|------|------|-----------------------|
| **Direct Labor** | $6,256 (37%) | $9,730 (52%) | $490 (45%) | $5,766 (12.8x) |
| **Ancillary Labor** | $423 (2%) | $622 (3%) | $31 (3%) | $392 (13.6x) |
| **PP&E** | $2,481 (15%) | $1,570 (8%) | $175 (16%) | $2,306 (14.2x) |
| **Medication & Material** | $7,900 (46%) | $7,000 (37%) | $395 (36%) | $7,505 (20.0x) |
| **TOTAL** | **$17,060 (100%)** | **$18,922 (100%)** | **$1,091 (100%)** | **$15,969 (15.6x)** |

### Resource Utilization (Minutes per CABG)

| Resource Category | Springfield | PMCC | TIHH | SH vs TIHH |
|-------------------|-------------|------|------|------------|
| **MD Costs** | 1,435 | 1,420 | 1,560 | (125) fewer |
| **Nursing & PCT** | 2,640 | 4,400 | 4,660 | (2,020) fewer |
| **Ancillary Labor** | 875 | 850 | 980 | (105) fewer |
| **PP&E (Space)** | 10,335 | 8,000 | 10,450 | (115) fewer |
| **TOTAL MINUTES** | **15,285** | **14,670** | **17,650** | **(2,365) fewer** |

**Key Insight**: Springfield uses 13% FEWER minutes than TIHH but costs 1,463% MORE. This suggests the cost differential is driven primarily by **capacity cost rates** (price per minute), not efficiency.

### Capacity Cost Rate Implications

| Example: Anesthesiologist | Springfield | TIHH | Ratio |
|----------------------------|-------------|------|-------|
| Annual Cost | $306,000 | $25,200 | 12.1x |
| Availability | 83% | 95% | - |
| Available Minutes | ~99,600 | ~114,000 | - |
| Cost per Minute | ~$3.07 | ~$0.22 | 14.0x |

**Key Finding**: Even after adjusting for currency exchange and macroeconomic indicators, US labor costs are 10-14x higher than emerging market costs.

### Cost Distribution Through Cycle of Care

| Phase | Springfield % | PMCC % | TIHH % |
|-------|---------------|--------|--------|
| **Pre-Operative** | 10% | 2% | 6% |
| **Surgery** | 55% | 46% | 58% |
| **Post-Operative** | 23% | 45% | 29% |
| **Discharge** | 3% | 3% | 4% |
| **Comfort** | 9% | 4% | 3% |

**Notable**: PMCC spends 45% of labor costs in Post-Operative phase (vs 23% for Springfield), reflecting patient-centric approach.

## Discussion Questions

1. Calculate the Capacity Cost Rate (CCR) for each of the resources involved in the CABG cycle of care for Pleasant Meadows Cardiovascular Care and The Institute for Heart Health. (Use the template in tab 1, "Calculate CCR").

2. Calculate the total cost of the processes performed on the first Post-Operatory Day at Springfield Hospital. You can use the template in tab "2. Cost of POD1 at SH".

3. What explains the difference in costs between SH and TIHH? (Use the template in tab "3. Variance Analysis"). In your calculations focus on the comparison between Springfield Hospital and the Indian Institute for Heart Health. When calculating the variances assume that the Indian Institute represents the actual and Springfield Hospital the expected number.

4. What caused the direct labor variance between the two institutions? How should Grainger and Turner interpret these results? What actions would you recommend they take to reduce the adverse cost differential?

## My Analysis & Recommendations

### Key Cost Drivers Identified

**1. Capacity Cost Rate (Price) Variance: ~85-90% of difference**
- US labor costs 10-14x higher than emerging market (even after macroeconomic adjustment)
- Facility and equipment costs similarly higher
- Medication and materials 20x higher
- **Largely outside Springfield's control** due to geographic and economic factors

**2. Efficiency (Resource Usage) Variance: Favorable for Springfield**
- Springfield uses 13% FEWER minutes than TIHH (15,285 vs 17,650)
- Springfield is actually MORE efficient in resource utilization
- Contradicts initial assumption that TIHH's processes were more efficient
- **Springfield's operational excellence culture IS working**

**3. Volume and Capacity Utilization: Significant but limited actionability**
- TIHH's 15.4x higher volume enables economies of scale
- Springfield's capacity availability ranges 65%-90% vs TIHH's 85%-100%
- Opportunity to improve resource utilization within constraints
- Cannot realistically achieve TIHH's volume (3,240 procedures)

### Option 1: Focus on Controllable Cost Drivers (Recommended)
**Pros**:
- Realistic acknowledgment that US labor/facility costs won't match emerging markets
- Builds on Springfield's existing operational excellence strengths
- Targets capacity utilization and supplier negotiations (actionable)
- Maintains quality while improving efficiency

**Cons**:
- Won't close full cost gap with TIHH
- Requires disciplined focus on incremental improvements
- May not satisfy CEO's initial expectations

**Implementation**:
1. Improve capacity utilization (target 90%+ availability for all resources)
2. Increase CABG volume through referral partnerships (target 300-400 procedures)
3. Negotiate supplier contracts for medications/materials (learn from TIHH's approach)
4. Optimize post-operative processes (Springfield 23% vs TIHH 29% - opportunity to standardize)

### Option 2: Learn from PMCC's Patient-Centric Model
**Pros**:
- Addresses CEO's concern about patient satisfaction (3 stars vs 5 stars)
- PMCC achieves lower average time despite high-touch care
- Opportunity to improve experience without sacrificing efficiency
- Differentiates Springfield beyond just low cost

**Cons**:
- May increase direct labor costs (PMCC at $9,730 vs Springfield $6,256)
- Requires culture change toward individualized attention
- Conflicts with production efficiency focus

**Implementation**:
1. Study PMCC's post-operative processes (45% of labor vs Springfield's 23%)
2. Implement patient communication protocols and comfort initiatives
3. Train staff on patient-centered care approaches
4. Measure HCAHPS ratings quarterly with improvement targets

### Option 3: Benchmark Against TIHH Production-Line Model
**Pros**:
- Highest volume hospital with proven efficiency
- Production-line processes align with "Toyota Hospital" philosophy
- Full capacity utilization (85%-100% availability)
- Strong supplier negotiation leverage

**Cons**:
- Springfield's volume (210) insufficient to replicate TIHH's model (3,240)
- US healthcare culture may resist production-line approach
- Price differences (not efficiency) drive most of cost gap
- Risk of sacrificing patient-centered care

**Implementation**:
1. Map TIHH's production-line process flows for specific phases
2. Identify transferable practices (scheduling, capacity utilization, supply chain)
3. Pilot production-line approach for specific phases (e.g., discharge process)
4. Monitor quality outcomes closely to ensure no degradation

### Recommended Action

> **Dual-Track Strategy**: (1) **Operational Focus** - Improve capacity utilization to 90%+, increase volume through partnerships to 350+ procedures, and negotiate supplier contracts targeting 15% reduction in medication/materials costs; (2) **Strategic Positioning** - Adopt selective patient-centered practices from PMCC to improve HCAHPS ratings to 4 stars while maintaining cost discipline.

**Rationale**: Springfield cannot compete on absolute cost with TIHH due to US economic realities (85-90% of difference). Instead, Springfield should:
- **Own the variance analysis narrative**: Demonstrate that efficiency is strong (13% fewer minutes) but CCR differences are geographic reality
- **Focus on controllable factors**: Capacity utilization, volume growth, supplier negotiations
- **Differentiate on patient experience**: Learn from PMCC to achieve "best quality-adjusted cost" positioning
- **Maintain operational excellence culture**: Continue measurement and continuous improvement, but recognize limitations

### Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Immediate (Months 1-3)**
- Complete full variance analysis using TDABC and templates provided
- Present findings to CEO with realistic interpretation of price vs efficiency drivers
- Launch capacity utilization improvement initiative (target 90%+ for all resources)
- Begin supplier negotiations for top 10 medication/supply items

**Phase 2: Short-Term (Months 4-9)**
- Develop referral partnerships with regional cardiologists (target +50% volume)
- Send team to observe PMCC's post-operative processes (learn patient-centered care)
- Pilot PMCC-inspired comfort and communication protocols
- Implement TIHH-style production-line scheduling for discharge phase

**Phase 3: Medium-Term (Months 10-18)**
- Achieve 300+ CABG procedures annually
- Improve capacity utilization to 88%+ average across all resources
- Reduce medication/materials costs by 10-15% through negotiations
- Improve HCAHPS rating from 3 stars to 3.5 stars

**Phase 4: Long-Term (Months 19-36)**
- Sustain 350+ CABG procedures annually
- Maintain 90%+ capacity utilization
- Achieve 4-star HCAHPS rating
- Position as "highest quality-adjusted value" in region (not lowest cost, but best value)

## Personal Reflections & Key Takeaways

### Synthesis of Learning
1. **Variance analysis reveals causality, not just differences**: The TDABC methodology enabled decomposition of cost differences into price (CCR), efficiency (minutes), and volume effects. Without this structured approach, Springfield might have incorrectly concluded their processes were inefficient when in fact they used 13% fewer minutes than TIHH.

2. **Geographic and economic realities create insurmountable cost barriers**: 85-90% of Springfield's cost disadvantage stems from US labor and facility costs being 10-14x higher than emerging markets. This case demonstrates the limits of operational excellence when fundamental economic factors dominate.

3. **"Toyota Hospital" requires operational philosophy, not just the name**: Springfield's measurement culture and continuous improvement focus ARE working (evidenced by efficiency advantage), but true Toyota Production System requires obsessive focus on capacity utilization, waste elimination, and volume throughput—areas where Springfield has opportunity.

4. **Time-Driven Activity-Based Costing enables meaningful healthcare comparisons**: Traditional overhead allocation systems would have made this comparison impossible. TDABC's focus on direct costs, process mapping, and capacity cost rates created actionable insights.

5. **Patient satisfaction and operational efficiency are not mutually exclusive**: PMCC achieves 5-star HCAHPS ratings with LOWER average time than Springfield. This contradicts the assumption that high-touch care requires more time—it requires better processes.

### Applications to Future Situations
- Use variance analysis framework to separate controllable from uncontrollable cost drivers
- Apply TDABC methodology when comparing costs across organizations with different systems
- Calculate capacity cost rates before jumping to efficiency improvement conclusions
- Consider quality-adjusted cost positioning when absolute cost leadership is unattainable
- Study both higher-performing and lower-performing benchmarks for balanced learning

### Questions for Further Research
- What happened after the study? Did Springfield implement changes?
- How did COVID-19 impact CABG costs and capacity utilization across these models?
- Can US hospitals achieve TIHH-level supplier negotiations at lower volumes?
- What specific processes enabled PMCC's higher patient satisfaction with lower time?
- How does the new ASC 606 revenue recognition standard affect hospital cost accounting?
