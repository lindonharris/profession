# Capitalizing Development Costs at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Volkswagen

## Quick Facts
- **Case #**: 9-121-018
- **Course**: [[FRC]]
- **Class #**: 7
- **Date Read**: 2025-10-05
- **Industry**: Automotive Manufacturing
- **Geography**: Global (Europe, North America, China, Brazil)

## Executive Summary
In 2019, auto companies worldwide spent $103B on R&D (3rd largest industry after pharma/biotech and tech hardware). Under IFRS, companies like FCA and VW could capitalize development costs meeting specific criteria and amortize over useful life. Under US GAAP, all R&D must be expensed when incurred. This case examines how these different standards affect financial reporting, comparability, and investor interpretation of FCA and VW's R&D accounting.

## Case Context

## Key Protagonists
- **FCA Management**:
  - Key decisions: R&D capitalization policy, development cost assumptions, useful life estimates
  - Constraints: IFRS requirements, competitive pressures, investor expectations

- **VW Management**:
  - Key decisions: R&D capitalization policy (different from FCA), electric vehicle investment
  - Challenges: Diesel scandal recovery, maintaining profitability, investor trust

- **Investors/Analysts**:
  - Challenge: Interpret differences in R&D accounting between FCA and VW
  - Question: Which company's numbers better reflect economic reality?

## Central Problem/Decision

### The Question
1. **Compare FCA's and VW's accounting for development costs in 2019**:
   - A. How much did each spend on R&D?
   - B. What proportion of R&D outlays did each capitalize?
   - C. What was average life of capitalized development costs?

2. **Assume FCA changed to match VW assumptions in 2019**:
   - How much R&D would be expensed immediately?
   - What would amortization expense be?
   - Are these effects significant?

3. **Why might FCA and VW use different assumptions?**
   - As investor, how to interpret differences? Why?

4. **Should FASB change U.S. reporting to require/allow capitalizing development costs?**
   - Why or why not?
   - Would views differ if you were auto executive vs. investor?

### Constraints
1. **Accounting standards**:
   - IFRS (FCA, VW): Can capitalize development costs meeting 6 criteria
   - US GAAP (U.S. companies): Must expense all R&D when incurred
2. Industry pressures: High R&D spending, stagnant sales, excess capacity
3. Investor expectations for comparability and transparency
4. Management incentives (reported profitability, metrics)

### Success Metrics
- Accurate representation of economic reality
- Comparability across companies
- Transparency for investors
- Alignment with management decision-making
- Industry-specific appropriateness

## Analysis

### Strengths (Capitalizing Development Costs - IFRS)
- **Matches costs with future revenues**: Development creates long-lived assets
- **Better reflects economic substance**: R&D creates intangible assets with future value
- **Smooths earnings**: Avoids large spikes in expense when R&D spending varies
- **Balance sheet shows intangible assets**: More complete picture of company resources
- **Management discretion**: Can reflect company-specific circumstances

### Weaknesses (Capitalizing Development Costs - IFRS)
- **Subjectivity**: Judgment required for 6 criteria (technical feasibility, intention, ability, future benefits, resources, reliable measurement)
- **Reduced comparability**: Different companies apply criteria differently
- **Potential manipulation**: Management can inflate assets/earnings by aggressive capitalization
- **Amortization assumptions**: Useful life estimates vary, affect comparability
- **Impairment risk**: If projects fail, large write-offs required

### Opportunities
- **IFRS approach allows flexibility**: Match accounting to business model
- **Better performance measurement**: Separate research (expense) from development (capitalize)
- **Enhanced disclosure**: Can provide more information about R&D projects
- **Investor analysis**: Can adjust for differences if well-disclosed

### Threats
- **Earnings management**: Incentive to capitalize aggressively to boost profits
- **Lack of comparability**: Difficult to compare FCA vs VW, or vs U.S. competitors
- **Future impairments**: If projects fail, sudden large charges
- **Audit challenges**: Hard to verify technical feasibility, future benefits

## Financial Analysis

### Question 1A: How much did each company spend on R&D in 2019?

**FCA (2019)** - From Exhibit 7:
| Category | Amount (€M) |
|----------|-------------|
| R&D expenditures expensed | €1,305 |
| Amortization of capitalized dev | €1,358 |
| Impairment/write-off of capitalized dev | €949 |
| **Total R&D expense** | **€3,612** |
| **Plus: Additions to capitalized dev** | **€2,889** |
| **Total R&D spending (outlays)** | **€6,501** |

**VW (2019)** - From Exhibit 8:
| Category | Amount (€M) |
|----------|-------------|
| R&D expenditures expensed | €9,534 |
| Amortization of capitalized dev | €4,049 |
| Impairment/write-off of capitalized dev | €(384) |
| **Total R&D expense** | **€13,199** |
| **Plus: Additions to capitalized dev** | **€5,171** |
| **Total R&D spending (outlays)** | **€18,370** |

**Summary**:
- FCA total R&D outlays: €6,501M
- VW total R&D outlays: €18,370M
- VW spends 2.8x more than FCA on R&D

### Question 1B: What proportion of R&D outlays did each capitalize?

**FCA (2019)**:
- Capitalized: €2,889M
- Total outlays: €6,501M
- **Capitalization rate: 44.4%**

**VW (2019)**:
- Capitalized: €5,171M
- Total outlays: €18,370M
- **Capitalization rate: 28.1%**

**Key insight**: FCA capitalizes much higher proportion (44%) vs VW (28%) despite being in same industry

### Question 1C: Average life of capitalized development costs?

**Calculation method**: Average life = Net carrying amount / Annual amortization

**FCA (2019)**:
- Net carrying amount (Dec 31): €10,507M
- Annual amortization: €1,358M
- **Average life: 10,507 / 1,358 = 7.7 years**

**VW (2019)**:
- Net carrying amount (Dec 31): €23,985M
- Annual amortization: €4,049M
- **Average life: 23,985 / 4,049 = 5.9 years**

**Key insight**: FCA amortizes over longer period (7.7 years) vs VW (5.9 years), suggesting FCA assumes longer useful life for development projects

### Question 2: If FCA matched VW assumptions in 2019

**Scenario**: FCA changes to VW's capitalization rate (28.1%) and useful life (5.9 years)

**New capitalization amount**:
- Total R&D outlays: €6,501M
- VW capitalization rate: 28.1%
- **New capitalized amount: €6,501 × 28.1% = €1,827M**
- Current capitalized: €2,889M
- **Additional expense: €2,889 - €1,827 = €1,062M**

**New amortization expense**:
- Net carrying amount: €10,507M
- VW average life: 5.9 years
- **New annual amortization: €10,507 / 5.9 = €1,781M**
- Current amortization: €1,358M
- **Additional amortization: €1,781 - €1,358 = €423M**

**Total impact on 2019 income**:
- Additional R&D expense: €1,062M
- Additional amortization: €423M
- **Total reduction to income: €1,485M**

**Significance**:
- 2019 net income: €6,630M
- Impact: €1,485M reduction
- **22.4% reduction in reported net income**
- **HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT**

## Discussion Questions

1. Compare FCA's and VW's accounting for development costs in 2019.
   - A. How much did each company spend on R&D?
   - B. What proportion of R&D outlays did each capitalize?
   - C. What was the average life of capitalized development costs communicated by the management teams of the two companies?

2. Assume that in 2019 FCA changed its assumptions to match those of VW. How much of its R&D outlays would have been expensed immediately? What would have been its amortization expense (based on the average life of capitalized development costs you estimated)? Are these effects significant?

3. Why might FCA and VW use different assumptions to capitalize and amortize their development costs? As an investor how would you interpret the differences? Why?

4. Would you recommend that the FASB change the reporting of development costs in the U.S. to require (or allow) companies to capitalize some share of development costs? Why or why not? Would your views differ if you were an auto executive or an investor?

## My Analysis & Recommendations

### Question 3: Why different assumptions? Investor interpretation?

**Possible reasons for differences**:

1. **Different R&D portfolios**:
   - FCA: Focused on platforms, powertrains (longer-lived, more certain)
   - VW: More diverse (includes new technologies like electric, autonomous - less certain)

2. **Conservative vs aggressive accounting**:
   - VW: More conservative (lower cap rate, shorter life) → higher quality earnings
   - FCA: More aggressive (higher cap rate, longer life) → inflated assets/earnings

3. **Diesel scandal impact (VW)**:
   - Post-scandal conservatism to rebuild credibility
   - Higher risk perception → expense more upfront

4. **Management incentives**:
   - FCA: Pressure to show profitability (capitalizing helps)
   - VW: Strong profitability despite scandal → can afford conservatism

5. **Auditor/regulator influence**:
   - Different countries, different enforcement
   - Different auditors may have different thresholds

6. **Business strategy differences**:
   - FCA: Incremental improvements to existing platforms
   - VW: More radical innovation (electric transformation)

**As investor, how to interpret**:

**Red flags for FCA**:
- Higher capitalization rate (44% vs 28%) suggests aggressive accounting
- Longer useful life (7.7 vs 5.9 years) reduces amortization expense
- If assumptions matched VW, net income would drop 22% → **earnings quality concern**
- Possible earnings management to meet targets

**Green flags for VW**:
- More conservative approach despite being profitable
- Lower capitalization suggests higher quality earnings
- Post-scandal: Incentive to be transparent, conservative

**Recommendation**:
- Adjust FCA's reported earnings downward for comparison purposes
- VW's earnings likely higher quality (more sustainable)
- Demand better disclosure from FCA about nature of capitalized projects
- Monitor FCA impairments (€949M in 2019 vs VW credit of €384M)

### Question 4: Should FASB allow/require capitalizing development costs?

**Arguments FOR capitalizing (change from current US GAAP)**:

1. **Economic substance**: Development creates long-lived intangible assets
2. **Matching principle**: Match costs with future revenues from those assets
3. **Better management decisions**: Don't penalize companies for investing in future
4. **International convergence**: Align US GAAP with IFRS (global comparability)
5. **Balance sheet completeness**: Show intangible assets created by R&D
6. **Industry-specific**: Auto industry has clear, identifiable development projects with future benefits

**Arguments AGAINST capitalizing (keep current US GAAP)**:

1. **Reliability**: Too subjective (technical feasibility, future benefits hard to verify)
2. **Earnings management risk**: Easy to manipulate by changing assumptions
3. **Conservatism**: Expensing provides more reliable, conservative earnings
4. **Comparability**: Companies would use different criteria (see FCA vs VW differences)
5. **Audit difficulty**: Hard to verify management's technical feasibility claims
6. **Impairment risk**: Large future write-offs if projects fail (see FCA €949M)
7. **Simplicity**: Current rule is clear, easy to apply uniformly

**My recommendation**:

**As investor**: **Do NOT change US GAAP** (keep expensing requirement)
- Prefer reliability over relevance for R&D
- FCA vs VW differences show how subjective capitalization is
- 22% swing in net income from assumption changes is too much discretion
- Can't trust management to apply criteria objectively
- Prefer conservative, comparable earnings

**As auto executive**: **ALLOW (not require) capitalization**
- Give option to capitalize if meet strict criteria
- Better reflects economic reality of long development cycles
- Helps communicate value creation to investors
- But make it optional with extensive disclosure requirements
- Require: Detailed disclosures of assumptions, sensitivity analysis, project-level detail

**Compromise solution**:
- Keep expense requirement as default
- Allow optional capitalization IF:
  1. Extensive disclosure of criteria, assumptions, project details
  2. Third-party verification of technical feasibility
  3. Sensitivity analysis showing impact of assumption changes
  4. Reconciliation to full-expense basis
  5. Enhanced audit scrutiny
- This gives executives flexibility while protecting investors
