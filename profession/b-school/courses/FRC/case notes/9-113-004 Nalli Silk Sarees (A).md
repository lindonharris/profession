# Nalli Silk Sarees (A)

## Quick Facts
- **Case #**: 9-113-004
- **Course**: [[FRC]]
- **Class #**: 12
- **Date Read**: 2025-10-08
- **Industry**: Retail/Textile
- **Geography**: India

## Executive Summary
Nalli Silk Sarees, an 83-year-old family-owned Indian ethnic wear retailer with $95M revenue and 22 stores, faces strategic decisions about its uniform pricing policy as it pursues aggressive expansion. Chairman Kuppusamy Chetty must evaluate whether to maintain the company's traditional fixed-margin pricing across all products and locations, or adopt differentiated pricing based on demand, competition, and location in an increasingly competitive market.

## Case Context

### Company Background
- **Founded**: 1928 by Nalli Chinnasamy Chetty (master weaver from Kanchipuram)
- **Growth trajectory**:
  - Started with 200 sq ft store in Chennai (1928)
  - Expanded to 30,000 sq ft flagship (1951) - 150x original size
  - Second store only after 57 years (1985 in Madurai)
  - Grew to 22 stores (20 domestic, 2 international) by 2011
- **Revenue**: $95 million (2011) - "Could have been billion-dollar brand" per chairman
- **Employees**: 2,000 total (15 sales staff, 50 executive)
- **Retail space**: 200,000 sq ft total across all stores
- **Core values**: Quality, integrity, customer service, innovation
  - *"For him, customers mattered most and he was willing to take great pains for them"*
  - *"Treating all products like our children - no discrimination"*
- **Brand positioning**: Only ethnic wear retailer with pan-India presence; synonymous with silk sarees
  - *"If you owned a South Indian silk saree, chances are it was probably a Nalli"*
- **Expansion plan**: $25M investment to open 12 new stores over 2 years (55% growth rate)

### Industry Landscape
- **Market**: Indian textile/apparel = 15% of industrial production (2010)
- **Silk market**: India = 2nd largest consumer and producer globally (after China); most silk used for sarees
- **Segment**: Ethnic wear dominated by small, privately owned regional stores (Nalli is unique national player)
- **Competition**: Intensifying from both large corporate chains and small discount stores
  - Chennai competitors: Kumaran Silk Sarees, Pothys, Sundari Silks (similar traditional focus)
  - Mumbai competitors: Kala Niketan, Roop Kala, Sheetal Sarees (embroidered/contemporary focus)
  - Competitors use heavy advertising, storewide sales, promotional "gimmicks"
- **Wedding market economics**:
  - Brides receive 11-21 silk sarees in trousseau (often family heirlooms)
  - Families purchase 40+ additional sarees for gift-giving at $100-200 each
  - Cultural significance creates high-value, high-volume opportunity
- **Supply challenges**:
  - Weaver shortage as younger generations shift to software jobs
  - Nalli has 5,000 dedicated vendors, 50 owned looms, 10,000 looms producing for them
  - Simple Kanchipuram sarees take 10-12 days; intricate patterns take 1 month
- **Raw material costs**:
  - Silk $30/kg vs cotton/wool $1-2/kg (15-30x differential)
  - Prices rising for silk and precious metals (gold/silver zari)
  - 2,000-3,000 cocoons needed per pound of silk
- **Consumer trends**:
  - Urban women increasingly choosing Western clothing over traditional sarees
  - Kuppusamy: *"Unless we have the younger generation wearing it, the saree could lose its pride of place"*
- **Customer loyalty**: Survey shows Indian consumers least loyal to stores (60%+ shop multiple retailers)
  - Industry experts question if Nalli's competitive outlook is realistic

### Timeline of Events

- **1951**: Moved to landmark 30,000 sq ft location in Chennai
- **1980s**: First textile retailer to use barcodes and computers for billing
- **1985**: Opened second store in Madurai (Tier-2 city)
- **1985+**: Expanded to major metros (Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore)
- **2007**: Network of 5,000 dedicated vendors; 10,000 looms producing for Nalli
- **2010**: Opened first mall-based store (Oberoi Mall, Mumbai) - 6,300 sq ft, $181K annual rent
- **2011**: Announced $25M expansion plan (12 new stores over 2 years)

## Key Protagonists
- **Nalli Kuppusamy Chetty**: Chairman (grandson of founder)
  - Background: 83 years old, third-generation family leader
  - Key decisions: Maintained fixed pricing policy, cautious expansion strategy, emphasis on customer service and values
  - Current challenge: Evaluating whether to maintain uniform pricing amid aggressive expansion

- **Lavanya Nalli**: Granddaughter (HBS MBA 2011)
  - Background: Recently graduated from Harvard Business School, joining top consulting firm
  - Role: Strategic advisor during brief visit to Chennai
  - Perspective: Brings modern business analysis to family-owned business

## Central Problem/Decision

### The Question
Should Nalli change its uniform pricing policy (fixed margin applied to all products across all locations) as it pursues aggressive expansion, and if so, how should it be implemented?

### Constraints
1. **Brand identity**: Strong values around integrity, quality, and treating all products equally ("like our children")
2. **Customer expectations**: No discounting, fixed prices - established reputation
3. **Competitive pressure**: Rivals offer heavy discounts and aggressive marketing
4. **Rising costs**: Rent (especially Mumbai: 154% increase since 2005), raw materials, labor shortages
5. **Operational complexity**: More stores, product categories, SKUs to manage
6. **Limited brand awareness**: Among new customer segments outside traditional base
7. **Cultural shift**: Urban consumers moving away from traditional sarees
8. **Supply constraints**: Weaver shortage limiting production capacity

### Success Metrics
- Store-level profitability (especially new locations like Oberoi Mall)
- Product category profitability
- Market share growth during expansion
- Maintenance of brand values and customer service standards
- Ability to compete with discounting rivals without compromising integrity

## Analysis

### Strengths
- **Brand equity**: Only pan-India ethnic wear retailer; synonymous with silk sarees
- **Quality reputation**: "Pure silk," "pure zari" labeling pioneer; return policy demonstrates confidence
- **Customer service**: Daily staff training, personalized service, no security scanners
- **Vendor relationships**: 5,000 dedicated vendors, flexible terms, deep integration
- **Culture**: 83-year history of integrity, innovation, customer-centricity
- **Product range**: One-stop shop for ethnic wear ($2-$2,000 price range)
- **Real estate**: Owns most early store properties (lower cost base)
- **Word-of-mouth**: Strong customer loyalty drives organic growth

### Weaknesses
- **Pricing rigidity**: Uniform margin regardless of demand, competition, location costs
- **Conservative expansion**: "Could have been a billion-dollar brand" - cautious growth strategy
- **No marketing**: Relies only on word-of-mouth vs aggressive competitor advertising
- **No discounting**: Never puts products on sale (unlike competitors)
- **Product portfolio complexity**: Wide range from fast-moving cotton to slow-moving dhotis
- **Shelf space**: Allocated by tradition (20% Kanchipuram) vs performance/profitability
- **Customization**: Accepts custom orders (long, expensive production cycle)
- **Limited analytics**: Traditional approach to pricing and merchandising decisions

### Opportunities
- **Expansion**: $25M plan for 12 new stores; untapped markets
- **Pricing optimization**: Differentiate by product, location, demand to improve profitability
- **Product mix**: Focus on high-margin silk sarees (brand heritage) vs low-value items
- **Shelf space**: Reallocate based on profitability and regional preferences
- **Mall format**: Learn from Oberoi Mall experiment; modern retail channels
- **Contemporary designs**: Attract younger urban consumers with designer/contemporary sarees
- **Activity-based costing**: Better understand product/store profitability

### Threats
- **Competition**: Large corporate chains + small discount stores intensifying pressure
- **Customer loyalty**: 60%+ Indians shop multiple retailers; brand loyalty declining
- **Supply shortage**: Weavers leaving for software jobs; labor constraints
- **Rising costs**: Raw silk, gold/silver prices increasing; Mumbai rent up 154% since 2005
- **Cultural shift**: Urban women choosing Western clothing over sarees
- **Price sensitivity**: Customers may defect to discounters during peak seasons
- **Expansion risk**: Maintaining values and service quality across rapid growth

## Financial Analysis

### Current Pricing Policy
- **Uniform markup**: Fixed ~32.5% margin applied to all products across all locations
- **Philosophy**: *"That's like discriminating among your own children. Why should I consider one child better than the other?"*
- **Ignores**:
  - Location cost differences (Mumbai rent vs owned Chennai property)
  - Product demand variations (customer willingness to pay)
  - Competitor pricing (aware but deliberately ignore)
  - Operating cost differences by product
- **Exception**: New market entry gets competition-based pricing for first year only

**Key Observations:**
- **Uniform 32.5% markup** applied regardless of product value, demand, or cost-to-serve
- **Kanchipuram ($2,000 range)** gets same margin as **Materials ($6 range)** - 333x price difference, same %
- **Inventory levels**: Materials (4,650), Cotton (2,860), Ready-to-Stitch (2,222) tie up significant working capital
- **Shelf space constraint**: Total 125 ft must be allocated - Materials use 20 ft (16%), Kanchipuram 25 ft (20%)
- **Staff time variance**: Banares (3 hrs) vs Dhotis (0 hrs) vs Materials (0.5 hrs) - labor cost differs 6x
- **Payment terms flexibility**: Banares (90 days credit) vs most others (15-30 days) - working capital benefit
- **Returns policy**: Silk sarees accepted, commodity items not - risk and handling cost differences

**Assignment Question 3: Calculate monthly profitability for each product after allocating all relevant costs**

*ABC Cost Drivers to Allocate:*
1. **Rent**: $181,731 annual / 12 = $15,144/month ÷ 125 ft shelf space = $121.15 per shelf foot per month
2. **Salary**: $64,904 annual / 12 = $5,409/month; allocate by staff time hours
3. **Utilities**: $112,404 annual / 12 = $9,367/month; allocate by floor space or shelf space
4. **Other costs**: $33,269 annual / 12 = $2,772/month; allocate proportionally
5. **Inventory carrying cost**: (Inventory pieces × Purchase price) × 15% annual ÷ 12 months

## Discussion Questions

### Question 1: How would you describe Nalli Silks' strategy?

**Nalli's strategy is premium quality differentiation through brand heritage, customer service excellence, and integrity:**

**Core Strategic Elements:**
1. **Quality leadership**: First to label "pure silk/pure zari," implement returns, source directly from weavers to control quality
2. **Customer service obsession**: Daily staff training, no security scanners (respect dignity), personalized service, amenities (parking, seating for families)
3. **Brand heritage**: 83-year history tied to Kanchipuram silk sarees (namesake product), family-owned trust preserving values
4. **National presence**: Only pan-India ethnic wear retailer (vs regional competitors) - unique positioning
5. **One-stop shop**: Broad portfolio ($2-$2,000) serving all customer needs for ethnic wear and home furnishings
6. **Word-of-mouth marketing**: Zero advertising budget, relying on customer loyalty and organic referrals
7. **Value-based operations**: No discounting, fixed prices, vendor partnerships, cautious expansion to preserve culture

**Strategic Positioning:**
- **Target**: Middle to upper-middle class Indian families seeking authentic, quality silk sarees for weddings and special occasions
- **Value proposition**: Trust, authenticity, quality assurance, personalized experience - *"Nalli stands for quality and honesty"*
- **Differentiation**: Integrity premium - customers pay for confidence they're getting real silk/zari when competitors use fakes

**Strategic Tension:**
- Past strategy emphasized **values over growth** ("could have been billion-dollar brand")
- Current context requires **scaling while preserving values** - aggressive expansion challenges service quality and operational simplicity

---

### Question 2: Is its pricing policy consistent with its strategy? What changes would you recommend?

**No - uniform pricing is INCONSISTENT with their premium differentiation strategy:**

**Inconsistencies:**
1. **Underprices premium products**: Kanchipuram silk sarees (brand heritage, customer WTP) get same 32.5% margin as cotton towels - fails to capture value for quality/authenticity
2. **Ignores brand equity**: "Synonymous with silk sarees" = pricing power, but uniform margins don't monetize this
3. **Cross-subsidization**: Premium products subsidize commodities after ABC allocation - contradicts quality focus
4. **Location blindness**: Mumbai (highest global rents) uses same margins as Chennai (owned property) - unsustainable for expansion
5. **Competitor vulnerability**: Discounters attack commodity categories while Nalli leaves silk premium on table

**Why It Worked Historically:**
- Limited SKU complexity (mostly silk sarees)
- Owned real estate (low cost base)
- Slow expansion (22 stores over 83 years)
- Strong brand moat in traditional customer base

**Why It Fails Now:**
- Product portfolio explosion creates cost allocation complexity
- Aggressive expansion (12 stores = 55% growth) in leased locations
- Competitive intensity (corporate chains + discounters)
- Eroding customer loyalty (60% shop multiple retailers)

**Recommended Pricing Changes:**

**Option A: Tiered Pricing by Product Category (Preserves "Integrity" Framing)**
- **Premium Tier** (Kanchipuram, Banares silk): 40-50% markup - reflects heritage, quality assurance, brand value
  - *Justification to values*: "Charging appropriately for the authenticity and craftsmanship we guarantee"
- **Core Tier** (Cotton sarees, embroidery): 30-35% markup - competitive with regional players
- **Commodity Tier** (Materials, dhotis, towels): 20-25% markup or EXIT - low strategic relevance
  - *Alternative*: Eliminate low-value categories, focus on saree expertise

**Option B: ABC-Informed Pricing (Data-Driven Approach)**
- Calculate true product profitability after allocating rent, labor, carrying costs
- Set prices to achieve target contribution margin after full ABC allocation
- Products that can't achieve minimum threshold get eliminated or repriced

**Option C: Hybrid - Value-Based Pricing for Signature Products**
- Maintain uniform pricing for commodity items (simplicity, operational ease)
- Premium pricing ONLY for Kanchipuram/Banares silks where brand differentiation is strongest
- Frame as *"Reflecting the true value of our heritage and guarantee of authenticity"*
- Customer research to test price sensitivity (likely inelastic for wedding purchases)

**Implementation Approach:**
1. **Phase 1**: Test at Oberoi Mall (new store, no established pricing expectations)
2. **Phase 2**: Customer communication - emphasize quality, heritage, authenticity (not "raising prices")
3. **Phase 3**: Roll out to new stores only (12 expansion locations)
4. **Phase 4**: Grandfather existing stores or slow transition over 2-3 years

**Key Risk Management:**
- **Brand integrity concern**: Frame changes as "properly valuing craftsmanship" not "discriminating"
- **Customer backlash**: Start with new locations/new customers (no expectation reset)
- **Competitive response**: Monitor if discounters can attack (unlikely on premium silks where authenticity matters)

### Question 3: Calculate monthly profitability for each product after allocating all relevant costs

**[To be completed with Excel calculations using Exhibits 3 & 4 data]**

**ABC Allocation Methodology:**

*Step 1: Calculate Activity Cost Rates*
- Rent cost per shelf foot: $15,144/month ÷ 125 ft = $121.15/ft/month
- Labor cost per hour: $5,409/month ÷ (30 staff × 8 hrs × 30 days) = Need staff hours per product
- Utilities per shelf foot: $9,367/month ÷ 125 ft = $74.94/ft/month
- Inventory carrying rate: 15% annual = 1.25% monthly

*Step 2: Allocate Costs to Products*
For each product category:
- **Rent allocation**: Shelf space (ft) × $121.15
- **Labor allocation**: Staff time (hrs/day) × 30 days × labor rate
- **Utilities allocation**: Shelf space (ft) × $74.94
- **Carrying cost**: Inventory (pieces) × Purchase price × 1.25%
- **Other costs**: Allocate proportionally by revenue or shelf space

*Step 3: Calculate Product Profitability*
For each product:
- **Revenue**: Monthly sales (pieces) × Sale price
- **COGS**: Monthly sales (pieces) × Purchase price
- **Gross profit**: Revenue - COGS
- **Less: ABC allocated costs** (rent + labor + utilities + carrying + other)
- **Operating profit**: Gross profit - Allocated costs
- **Operating margin %**: Operating profit ÷ Revenue

**Expected Findings:**
- **Kanchipuram**: Likely profitable but margin lower than gross margin suggests (high inventory, long staff time)
- **Cotton sarees**: High profitability due to fast turnover, reasonable space usage
- **Materials/Dhotis**: Likely UNPROFITABLE after allocations (consume space/inventory, low revenue per piece)
- **Banares silk**: Interesting case - high staff time (3 hrs) but 90-day payment terms reduce carrying cost

**Strategic Implications:**
Products with negative operating margins should be repriced, reduced shelf space, or eliminated to improve overall store profitability.

## My Analysis & Recommendations

### Option 1: Maintain Uniform Pricing Policy
**Pros**:
- Preserves brand values and "treating all children equally" philosophy
- Simplifies operations across expanding store network
- Maintains customer trust and reputation for integrity
- Avoids complexity of dynamic pricing systems

**Cons**:
- Leaves money on table for premium products (Kanchipuram silk)
- Doesn't account for location-specific cost differences (Mumbai rent)
- Can't compete effectively with discounters in price-sensitive segments
- May subsidize unprofitable products/stores with profitable ones

### Option 2: Differentiated Pricing by Product/Location
**Pros**:
- Optimizes profitability by product category and store location
- Premium pricing for heritage Kanchipuram sarees aligned with brand
- Competitive pricing for commodity products (cotton sarees, materials)
- Better reflects cost structure differences across locations

**Cons**:
- Risks diluting brand integrity and "no discrimination" philosophy
- Implementation complexity across 22+ stores
- May confuse customers accustomed to consistent pricing
- Requires sophisticated analytics and pricing systems

### Option 3: Focus Portfolio + Tiered Pricing
**Pros**:
- Concentrate on high-margin silk sarees (brand heritage)
- Exit or reduce low-value categories (dhotis, towels)
- Premium tier for Kanchipuram/Banares; competitive tier for cotton
- Simplifies operations while optimizing profitability

**Cons**:
- Abandons "one-stop shop" positioning
- May lose customers seeking convenience of full range
- Supply chain adjustments with vendors
- Transition challenges during expansion phase

### Recommended Action
Implement **hybrid strategy** combining product portfolio optimization with selective pricing adjustments:

1. **Maintain uniform pricing within product tiers** (preserve integrity principle)
2. **Create three tiers**: Premium (Kanchipuram, Banares silk), Core (cotton, embroidery sarees), Commodity (materials, dhotis)
3. **Apply higher margins to Premium tier** (customer willingness to pay for quality/heritage)
4. **Rationalize product mix**: Reduce shelf space for low-value, slow-moving items
5. **Location-specific pricing only for new markets** (first year, then standardize)
6. **Activity-based costing**: Allocate costs by shelf space, staff time, inventory carrying

### Implementation Plan
1. **Phase 1 (Months 1-3)**: Conduct full profitability analysis using ABC methodology on Oberoi Mall pilot
2. **Phase 2 (Months 4-6)**: Test tiered pricing model at 2-3 stores; measure customer response and profitability impact
3. **Phase 3 (Months 7-12)**: Roll out to existing stores; train staff on value communication; adjust product mix
4. **Phase 4 (Year 2+)**: Apply optimized model to 12 new stores in expansion plan; monitor and refine

## Personal Reflections & Key Takeaways

### Synthesis of Learning
1. **[Cost allocation methodology drives strategic decisions]**: The case demonstrates how activity-based costing reveals true product and store profitability, enabling data-driven decisions about pricing, product mix, and expansion strategy. Traditional cost allocation (uniform margins) may hide unprofitable categories subsidized by profitable ones.

2. **[Brand values must evolve with business complexity]**: Nalli's "treating all products equally" philosophy served the business well for 83 years, but aggressive expansion and competitive pressure require balancing core values with profitability optimization. The challenge is adapting pricing strategy without compromising brand integrity.

3. **[Retail profitability requires multiple dimensions of analysis]**: Product profitability, store profitability, and customer profitability are interconnected. Decisions about shelf space allocation, vendor terms, staffing levels, and product mix all impact the bottom line and must be analyzed holistically.

### Applications to Future Situations
- Use ABC methodology when evaluating multi-product businesses to avoid cross-subsidization
- Consider how business model evolution may require updating founding principles
- Analyze cost drivers (space, time, capital) when optimizing retail operations
- Balance expansion speed with operational capability and brand consistency

### Questions for Further Research
- What is the actual customer price sensitivity for Nalli's premium silk sarees?
- How do competitor pricing strategies impact Nalli's market share by product category?
- What is the optimal product mix for different store formats (flagship vs mall vs Tier-2 city)?
- How can Nalli use technology to improve inventory management and reduce carrying costs?
- What is the customer lifetime value for Nalli's core silk saree buyers vs commodity product buyers?
