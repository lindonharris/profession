# Stock-Based Compensation at Twitter

## Quick Facts
- **Case #**: 9-119-032
- **Course**: [[FRC]]
- **Class #**: 9
- **Date Read**: 2025-10-05
- **Industry**: Technology/Social Media
- **Geography**: United States

## Executive Summary
Twitter reported a $108M GAAP net loss for 2017, but emphasized non-GAAP net income of $329M—stripping out stock-based compensation expense. As hedge fund analyst Olivia Nash reviews Q4 2017 results, she must evaluate whether stock-based compensation is a true expense, why analysts condone non-GAAP metrics, and how this reporting impacts Twitter's profitability and management.

## Case Context

### Company Background
**Twitter Founding (2006)**:
- Spun out of failed podcasting startup Odeo
- Founders: Jack Dorsey, Evan Williams, Noah Glass, Biz Stone
- Original purpose: Stay connected through 140-character "tweets" via SMS
- First tweet: "just setting up my twttr" - Jack Dorsey, March 21, 2006
- Initial user experience: Send SMS to 40404, followers receive text message

**Evolution**:
- Emerged as information network, not just social network
- Use cases: Following celebrities, breaking news, real-time public discourse
- 2009: Raised money at $1.2B valuation despite $0 revenue
- 2010: Dick Costolo became CEO, focused on sustainable business model
- Created advertising-based revenue (promoted tweets)
- Grew from 30 → 2,000 employees; ~20M → ~200M monthly active users; $0 → $665M revenue by IPO

**IPO & Public Trading (2013-2017)**:
- November 7, 2013: IPO at ~$26/share, ended first day +73% at $44.90
- Market value: >$24 billion
- Struggled vs. Facebook, Instagram, Snap growth expectations
- July 2015: Costolo stepped down, Dorsey returned as CEO
- May 2016: Stock hit all-time low of $13.90 (down ~70% from first day)
- July 2014: Anthony Noto joined as CFO
- August 2017: Ned Segal joined as CFO
- February 2018: Anthony Noto left (was COO)

### Industry Landscape
**Stock-Based Compensation Practices**:
- Common among technology companies for recruiting and retention
- Shift from stock options to RSUs in 2010s as companies stayed private longer
- Accounting change (ASU 2016-09): Account for forfeitures as they occur vs. estimate
- Widespread use of non-GAAP metrics excluding SBC expense
- Wall Street analysts judged performance primarily on non-GAAP metrics

**Compensation Mechanisms**:
- **Stock Options**: Right to purchase shares at predetermined exercise price; only valuable if stock price rises
- **RSUs (Restricted Stock Units)**: Actual shares granted; valuable unless stock price drops to $0
- **Vesting**: Typically 4-year linear with 1-year cliff, then quarterly
- Example: 400 RSUs → 100 vest year 1, then 25/quarter for 3 years

### Timeline of Events
- **March 2006**: Twitter founded; first tweet
- **2009**: Raised money at $1.2B valuation (pre-revenue)
- **2010**: Dick Costolo became CEO; launched ad-based revenue model
- **November 7, 2013**: IPO at ~$26, closed at $44.90 (+73%)
- **July 2014**: Anthony Noto joined as CFO
- **July 2015**: Costolo stepped down, Dorsey returned as CEO
- **May 2016**: Stock hit all-time low $13.90
- **Fiscal 2017**: ASU 2016-09 came into effect (forfeitures accounted as they occur)
- **August 2017**: Ned Segal joined as CFO
- **Q4 2017**: Earnings call emphasized non-GAAP net income of $329M vs. GAAP loss of $108M
- **Early 2018**: Olivia Nash (fictional analyst) reviews results; Anthony Noto left
- **February 2018**: Anthony Noto departed

## Key Protagonists
- **Ned Segal**: Chief Financial Officer (August 2017+)
  - Background: Joined from investment banking/private equity
  - Key decisions: Managing market pressures to reduce SBC use; considering cash-based bonus alternatives
  - Challenges: Balancing GAAP reporting with non-GAAP metrics; investor perception of profitability

- **Jack Dorsey**: Co-founder & CEO (2006-2008, 2015+)
  - Background: Original co-founder, returned after Costolo
  - Philosophy: Twitter as "information network" democratizing access to information
  - Key decisions: Company strategy during turnaround period

- **Olivia Nash**: Analyst at BlueShark Capital Management (Fictional)
  - Background: MBA grad, 5 years with hedge fund, technology sector coverage
  - Key decisions: Evaluating Twitter's true profitability; assessing GAAP vs. non-GAAP metrics

## Central Problem/Decision

### The Question
1. Is stock-based compensation a true expense?
2. Which better reflects Twitter's period performance: GAAP net income or non-GAAP "adjusted earnings"?
3. How should Ned Segal manage market pressures to reduce SBC use?
4. Should Segal introduce cash-based performance bonus program?

### Constraints
1. Market expectations for profitability (non-GAAP shows profit, GAAP shows loss)
2. Need to attract and retain top talent in competitive tech labor market
3. Cash flow constraints (SBC avoids cash outflows)
4. GAAP accounting requirements vs. investor preferences for non-GAAP
5. Stock price has been volatile ($44.90 first day IPO → $13.90 low → recovery)
6. Competing with Facebook, Instagram, Snap for talent and market share

### Success Metrics
- Employee recruitment and retention rates
- Stock price performance
- Investor confidence and analyst ratings
- Cash flow management
- Reported profitability (GAAP vs. non-GAAP)
- Alignment of employee and shareholder interests

## Analysis

### Strengths (Stock-Based Compensation)
- No immediate cash outflow (preserves cash for operations)
- Attracts top talent with upside potential
- Retains employees through vesting schedules (especially 1-year cliff)
- Aligns employee and shareholder interests (employees become owners)
- Particularly effective for recruiting senior executives from established companies
- Industry-standard practice (competitive necessity)
- Non-GAAP metrics show profitability attractive to investors

### Weaknesses (Stock-Based Compensation)
- Dilutes existing shareholders
- Significant GAAP expense ($437M difference between GAAP and non-GAAP in 2017)
- May incentivize short-term stock price manipulation
- Accounting complexity (vesting schedules, forfeitures, valuation)
- Stock price volatility affects value received by employees
- Creates pressure to use non-GAAP metrics (obscures "true" profitability)
- Optics issue: Reporting GAAP losses while emphasizing non-GAAP profits

### Opportunities
- Industry-wide acceptance of non-GAAP metrics provides flexibility
- Could introduce performance-based vesting tied to specific metrics
- Mix of cash and equity could provide more predictable compensation
- RSUs provide value even if stock doesn't appreciate (unlike options)
- ASU 2016-09 simplifies accounting (forfeitures as they occur)

### Threats
- Increased regulatory scrutiny of non-GAAP metrics
- Investor skepticism about "adjusted earnings"
- Competitive talent market may require increasing SBC grants
- Stock price decline reduces effectiveness as retention tool
- Shareholder dilution concerns
- Pressure from activists to reduce SBC and improve GAAP profitability

## Financial Analysis
| Metric | 2017 Value | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| GAAP Net Income | ($108M) | Net loss |

## Discussion Questions
1. Perform the journal entries for a hypothetical stock grant (RSU) for Twitter's annual financial statements using the following information. On January 1, 2018, Twitter granted 100 shares with a market price of $10. The employee must work 4 years at which time the award is vested. Under GAAP, the grant-date fair value (based on grant-date price) is amortized (spread evenly) over the vesting period.

2. Which better reflects the economic reality of Twitter's period performance: GAAP net income or its non-GAAP "adjusted earnings" measure? What are the strengths and weaknesses of each measure? When are non-GAAP metrics valuable? What concerns do you have about them?

3. Why do firms like Twitter use stock-based compensation (SBC)? If you are Ned Segal, how would you manage market's pressures to reduce the use of SBC?

4. Should Ned Segal introduce a cash-based performance bonus program at Twitter? What advantages or disadvantages do you see in this alternative compensation scheme?

## My Analysis & Recommendations

### Question 1: RSU Journal Entries
**Grant: January 1, 2018 - 100 shares @ $10 = $1,000 total value**
**Vesting: 4 years, linear**
**Annual expense: $1,000 / 4 = $250/year**

**Year 1-4 (each year)**:
- DR: Stock-Based Compensation Expense $250
- CR: Additional Paid-In Capital $250

**Upon vesting (Year 4)**:
- No additional entry (APIC already credited over 4 years)
- If employee exercises/receives shares: transfer from APIC to Common Stock

### Question 2: GAAP vs. Non-GAAP Assessment

**GAAP Net Income (-$108M) Strengths**:
- Follows standardized accounting principles
- Reflects economic reality that employees consume resources
- Comparable across companies (consistent methodology)
- Required disclosure, audited

**GAAP Net Income Weaknesses**:
- Non-cash expense may overstate cash burn
- SBC measurement can be subjective (valuation)
- Doesn't reflect whether SBC created shareholder value
- May penalize growth companies disproportionately

**Non-GAAP Net Income ($329M) Strengths**:
- Shows cash profitability/operating performance
- Focuses on controllable expenses
- Allows period-to-period comparisons without SBC volatility
- Industry standard for tech companies

**Non-GAAP Net Income Weaknesses**:
- Ignores real economic cost (employee compensation)
- Lacks standardization (companies define differently)
- Can be manipulated to show desired results
- Obscures shareholder dilution

**Recommendation**: GAAP better reflects economic reality. SBC is compensation—employees provide services in exchange. Non-GAAP is useful supplemental information for understanding cash flows, but primary focus should be GAAP.

### Question 3: Managing SBC Pressures

**Why Twitter Uses SBC**:
1. Talent attraction (competitive labor market)
2. Retention through vesting schedules
3. Cash preservation (no immediate outflow)
4. Alignment with shareholders (employees become owners)
5. Industry standard (competitive necessity)

**How to Manage Pressures**:
1. **Educate investors**: Emphasize that SBC is necessary for talent competitiveness
2. **Show efficiency**: Demonstrate SBC grants declining as % of revenue over time
3. **Performance-based vesting**: Tie some SBC to metrics (revenue, MAUs, profitability)
4. **Transparent communication**: Clear explanation of SBC methodology and rationale
5. **Balanced approach**: Mix of cash and equity (address some concerns while maintaining benefits)

### Question 4: Cash-Based Performance Bonus Program

**Advantages**:
- No shareholder dilution
- More predictable expense for accounting
- Simpler for employees to understand
- Immediate value (not dependent on stock price)
- Addresses investor concerns about GAAP profitability

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires cash outflows (constrains operations/growth)
- Doesn't align employees with long-term shareholder value
- No retention benefit after bonus paid
- Competitive disadvantage vs. tech peers using SBC
- May not attract top talent from other companies offering equity
- Short-term focus (annual bonuses vs. multi-year vesting)

**Recommendation**: **Do not fully replace SBC with cash bonuses**. Instead, introduce hybrid model with performance-based cash bonuses for short-term goals and continued SBC for long-term alignment. This addresses some investor concerns while maintaining competitive compensation structure.
