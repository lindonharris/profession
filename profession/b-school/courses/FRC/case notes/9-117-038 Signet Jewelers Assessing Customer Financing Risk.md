# Signet Jewelers: Assessing Customer Financing Risk

## Quick Facts
- **Case #**: 9-117-038
- **Course**: [[FRC]]
- **Date Read**: 2025-10-05
- **Industry**: Retail/Jewelry
- **Geography**: United States
- **Timeframe**: 2016-2017

## Executive Summary
Short-seller Marc Cohodes targeted Signet Jewelers in early 2016, claiming the world's largest specialty jewelry retailer was "heading for a cliff" due to a toxic customer financing program masked by aggressive "recency accounting." Signet, owner of Kay, Zales, and Jared brands, relied heavily on in-house customer financing (62% of Sterling division sales in FY2016), extending credit to subprime borrowers to drive engagement ring sales. The case examines whether Signet's financial statements accurately reflect credit quality and whether the company's competitive advantage is sustainable or a dangerous addiction to risky lending.

- **Strategy**: Announced credit portfolio review, Leonard Green investment, potential sale of credit book

## Central Problem/Decision

### The Question
> Are Marc Cohodes and other short-sellers correct that Signet's customer financing program represents unsustainable credit risk that is masked by aggressive "recency accounting," or is Signet's in-house financing a legitimate competitive advantage as management claims?

### Analytical Questions
1. **Credit Quality**: How risky is Signet's $1.9B receivables portfolio?
2. **Accounting Policy**: Does recency accounting appropriately reflect credit risk vs. contractual method?
3. **Business Model**: Is 62% financing penetration sustainable or evidence of addiction to credit-driven sales?
4. **Asset Quality**: Can Signet's jewelry support the credit extended (i.e., can you repo an engagement ring)?

### Constraints & Context
1. **Recency vs. Contractual Accounting Debate**:
   - **Recency**: Customers current if pay 75%+ of scheduled payment
   - **Contractual**: Customers current only if pay 100% on time
   - Federal Reserve: Contractual preferred for "financial statement transparency"
   - Signet: Only major retailer still using recency

2. **Customer Credit Profile**:
   - Average FICO: 660 (marginally above 640 subprime threshold)
   - Comparable to <50% median family income borrowers
   - US average FICO: 695

3. **Economic Headwinds**:
   - Revenue down 12% (2001-2005) while cars cleaned up 12%
   - Part-time employee shift (26% → 52% of workforce)
   - Bankruptcies naming Signet: 1,903 (Q1 2015) → 3,274 (Q1 2016), +72%

## Analysis

### Signet's Financing Program: Key Metrics

**Scale & Penetration** (Sterling Division):
| Metric | FY2012 | FY2016 | Trend |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Credit sales as % of total | 56.9% | 62.0% | ↑ 5.1pp |
| Credit sales ($M) | $1,863 | $2,438 | +31% |
| Active accounts | 1,173K | 1,401K | +19% |
| Avg balance | $1,110 | $1,405 | +27% |
| Gross receivables ($M) | $1,281 | $1,952 | +52% |

**Credit Performance Deterioration**:
| Metric | FY2012 | FY2016 | Analysis |
|--------|--------|--------|----------|
| Bad debt / credit sales | 6.6% | 8.7% | +210 bps |
| Bad debt allowance / gross AR | 6.8% | 7.1% | Modest increase |
| Net write-offs / avg gross AR | 9.2% | 10.7% | +150 bps |
| Delinquency >90 days (recency) | 3.6% | 3.8% | Suspiciously stable |
| Bad debt expense ($M) | $122 | $212 | +74% |

**Profitability of Credit Program**:
| Component | FY2012 | FY2016 |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Interest income | $160M | $278M |
| Late charge income | $28M | $36M |
| Bad debt expense | ($122M) | ($212M) |
| **Net contribution** | **$65M** | **$102M** |

### Red Flags Supporting Cohodes' Thesis

**1. Recency Accounting Masks True Delinquencies**
- **Mechanism**: Customer can be 2-3 payments behind but still "current" if makes qualifying payments
  - 75% of scheduled payment = current
  - 2 payments behind = 1 full payment to return to current
  - 3+ payments behind = full past due amount required
- **Impact**: Delinquency rates artificially low vs. contractual method
- **Evidence**: Non-performing loans steady at 3.6-3.8% (2012-2016) despite deteriorating credit
  - Analyst: "Rare to see such limited movement... suggests use of recency to produce stable numbers"

**2. Receivables Growing Faster Than Revenue**
- **Receivables CAGR** (2012-2016): 13.2%
- **Revenue CAGR** (2012-2016): 10.4%
- **Implication**: Either relaxing credit standards or customers taking longer to pay

**3. Increasing Dependence on Subprime Borrowers**
- FICO 660 = marginally above 640 subprime threshold
- Grant's Interest Rate Observer: "marginally higher than 640 threshold of subprime"
- Estimated 35% of receivables from subprime borrowers
- Customers <50% median family income: average FICO 664

**4. Bankruptcy Filings Accelerating**
- Personal bankruptcies naming Signet as creditor:
  - Q1 2015: 1,903
  - Q4 2015: 2,663
  - Q1 2016: 3,274 (+72% YoY)

**5. Jewelry Has No Recoverable Collateral Value**
- **Cohodes**: "How do you repo a ring?... You can't repo jewelry like a car or house with title"
- **Signet's markup**: "trinkets" with minimal resale value
- **Contrast**: Blue Nile/Tiffany sell appraisable assets (2-carat G-color VS1)
- **Recovery rate**: Only 18% of written-off amounts recovered

**6. Extended Service Plans (ESPs) Drive Profitability**
- ESP revenue: $348M (5.5% of total revenue in FY2016)
- **Sales tactic**: Ring sizing costs almost same as ESP, so "free" sizing sells ESP
- **Cohodes**: "Why you need an extended warranty on jewelry is beyond me"
- **Issue**: Material portion of operating earnings (undisclosed margin)

### Counter-Arguments Supporting Signet

**1. Financing Enables Incremental Sales**
- 75% of Sterling bridal sales use financing
- "Lifetime value" of financed customer = 3.5x non-financed
- Average transaction value higher with financing
- Competitors lack scale to offer in-house programs

**2. Fast Turnover Reduces Risk**
- Portfolio turns over every 9 months
- Weighted average minimum payment: 9% of balance (vs. 3-5% for credit cards)
- 97% of payments ≥ scheduled monthly payment

**3. Financial Results Same Regardless of Method**
- **CFO Santana**: "Regardless of recency or contractual... the provision will be the same, our bad debt expense will be the same"
- **Signet**: 30 years of experience with recency; "worked well for us"

**4. Competitive Advantage in Fragmented Market**
- No competitor has >1% market share
- Blue Nile and Tiffany offer only third-party financing or limited programs
  - Tiffany AR: $72M (97% current), allowance $1.1M
  - Blue Nile: No in-house financing
- Infrastructure costs high (30% of interest income per analysts)

**5. Leonard Green Validation**
- $625M convertible preferred investment (Aug 2016)
- **Light**: "A firm doing due diligence... validates our business model"
- **Cohodes counter**: "High juice loan... first in capital structure... what do they care?"

## Financial Analysis

### Accounts Receivable Quality Deterioration

**Bad Debt Allowance Analysis**:
```
FY2012: $87.7M / $1,280.6M gross AR = 6.8%
FY2016: $138.7M / $1,952.0M gross AR = 7.1%
```
Only +30 bps increase despite:
- 31% growth in credit sales
- 72% increase in bankruptcy filings
- Shift to more part-time employees (lower quality origination)

**Write-Off Acceleration**:
```
Net write-offs:
FY2012: $112.8M / average AR $1,228M = 9.2%
FY2016: $203.4M / average AR $1,904M = 10.7%
```

**Bad Debt Expense as % of Credit Sales**:
| FY | Credit Sales | Bad Debt | % |
|----|--------------|----------|---|
| 2012 | $1,863M | $122M | 6.6% |
| 2013 | $2,028M | $138M | 6.8% |
| 2014 | $2,277M | $160M | 7.0% |
| 2015 | $2,451M | $191M | 7.8% |
| 2016 | $2,438M | $212M | 8.7% |

**Trend**: Steady deterioration; 210 bps increase in 4 years

### Recency vs. Contractual Comparison

**Aging Analysis (FY2016)**:
| Category | Gross AR | % | Bad Debt Allowance | % Reserved |
|----------|----------|---|-------------------|------------|
| Current (0-30 days) | $1,538M | 78.8% | $47M | 3.1% |
| Past due 31-60 days | $282M | 14.4% | $9M | 3.2% |
| Past due 61-90 days | $52M | 2.6% | $2M | 4.5% |
| Non-performing >90 days | $80M | 4.1% | $80M | 100.0% |
| **Total** | **$1,952M** | **100%** | **$139M** | **7.1%** |

**Question**: What would delinquency look like under contractual method?
- If customers can be current while being 2-3 payments behind...
- True >30 day delinquency likely much higher than 21.2% shown

### Impact of Potential Credit Book Sale

**Wells Fargo Analyst Estimates**:
- Credit portfolio book value: $1.7B
- Potential sale price: $1.5B (haircut needed)
- Subprime receivables (35%): $595M at 25-30% discount = -$149-$178M
- Prime receivables (65%): $1,105M at 5% discount = -$55M
- **Total haircut**: $204-$233M

**Revenue Impact**:
- $600M needed to repay securitization
- $800-850M lost revenues from lost control
- Credit program = 15-20% of annual EPS at risk

### Cash Flow & Liquidity Concerns

**Operating Cash Flow Trends**:
| FY | Net Income | CFO | FCF (CFO - Capex) |
|----|-----------|-----|------------------|
| 2012 | $360M | $313M | $179M |
| 2014 | $381M | $283M | $63M |
| 2016 | $543M | $678M | $400M |

**Note**: FY2016 CFO boost from:
- Change in unearned revenue: +$44M
- Change in payables: -$7M
- But receivables grew $102M (cash drag)

**Debt & Leverage**:
- LT Debt: $1,318M (FY2016)
- Convertible Preferred: $612M (Leonard Green, Aug 2016)
- Debt/Equity: 0.53x
- Stock buyback: $1,000M (FY2016)

## Discussion Questions

**From the case**:
1. How should investors assess the credit risk in Signet's customer financing program?
2. What are the implications of Signet's use of recency accounting vs. contractual accounting?
3. Is the customer financing program a sustainable competitive advantage or a dangerous dependence?
4. How should Signet's accounts receivable and bad debt reserves be analyzed?

## My Analysis & Recommendations

### Assessment of Cohodes' Thesis

**Strong Points**:
1. **Recency accounting clearly understates delinquencies** - Federal Reserve explicitly discourages it for transparency
2. **Credit quality deteriorating** - Bad debt/credit sales: 6.6% → 8.7% while reported delinquencies stable
3. **Bankruptcy filings accelerating** - +72% YoY is alarming
4. **No collateral value** - Unlike auto/mortgage lending, cannot repo jewelry effectively
5. **Business model addiction** - 62% penetration means sales collapse if credit tightens

**Weak Points**:
1. **CFO correct that ultimate P&L impact same** - Bad debt expense eventually catches up
2. **30 years of history** - Model survived 2008-2009 crisis (though NPLs peaked at 5%)
3. **Fast turnover** - 9-month average reduces risk vs. longer-term loans
4. **Analyst support** - Wells Fargo, Deutsche Bank see risk as overstated

### Accounting Analysis

**Recency Accounting Assessment**:
- **Purpose**: "Puts customer first" by allowing flexibility during tough months
- **Reality**: Masks true delinquency, delays recognition of credit problems
- **Comparison**: No other major retailer uses recency
- **Regulatory view**: Federal Reserve says contractual "provides more accurate reflection of loan performance"

**What contractual method would reveal**:
- Customers 31-60 days late: need 2 full payments to catch up
- Customers 61-90 days late: need 3 full payments
- Many "current" accounts under recency would be delinquent under contractual
- **Estimated impact**: Delinquency could be 2-3x higher

**Bad Debt Reserve Adequacy**:
```
Current reserve: 7.1% of gross AR
Net write-offs: 10.7% of average gross AR
```
**Analysis**: Reserves may be understated if write-off rate (10.7%) exceeds reserve rate (7.1%)
- This works only if recoveries are high OR new originations outpace write-offs
- Recovery rate of 18% suggests reserves should be higher

### Business Model Sustainability

**Bull Case**:
- Fragmented market with growth runway
- Competitors cannot replicate financing at scale
- Bridal market stable, 75% of sales use financing
- Leonard Green investment validates model

**Bear Case**:
- Addicted to credit: 62% of sales require financing
- Customer quality degrading (FICO 660 = near-subprime)
- Cannot sell credit book without massive haircut ($200-230M loss)
- Reputational damage (gender discrimination, diamond swapping)
- Economic model: Sell overpriced "trinkets" on credit to subprime borrowers

### Recommended Action for Investors

**Short-term (6-12 months)**:
- **Neutral to Bearish** - Credit portfolio review creates uncertainty
- Watch for:
  - Q3/Q4 FY2017 credit metrics
  - Credit book sale announcement (and pricing)
  - Same-store sales trends (are they maintaining 62% penetration?)

**Medium-term (1-2 years)**:
- **Depends on credit book outcome**:
  - If sold: 15-20% EPS hit, but de-risks balance sheet
  - If retained: Must prove credit quality stable
- FASB impairment guidance (effective Dec 2018) will require expected credit loss model
  - This could force higher reserves

**Long-term (3+ years)**:
- **Structural headwinds**:
  - Online competition (Blue Nile growing)
  - Diamond demand/prices falling
  - Millennial preferences shifting
  - Stigma from scandals (gender discrimination, diamond swapping)

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Credit sales as % of total** - Is dependence increasing?
2. **Bad debt expense / credit sales** - Continued deterioration?
3. **Bankruptcy filings** - Acceleration continuing?
4. **Average FICO score** - Migrating down to deeper subprime?
5. **Receivables / Revenue ratio** - Growing faster than sales?
6. **Reserve / Write-off ratio** - Reserves catching up to losses?

### Teaching Takeaways

1. **Accounting policy matters** - Recency vs. contractual creates vastly different pictures
2. **Credit risk is real risk** - Even if "ultimate P&L same," timing matters for solvency
3. **Business model analysis** - Is financing a feature or a bug? Competitive advantage or addiction?
4. **Short-seller analysis** - Cohodes brings legitimate questions about sustainability
5. **Management incentives** - Recency accounting allows reporting "stable" delinquencies while quality deteriorates
