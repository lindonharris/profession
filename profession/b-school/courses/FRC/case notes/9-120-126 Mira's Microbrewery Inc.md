- **Geography**: Boston, MA

## Executive Summary
> Mira Davis, a computer engineering graduate, founded a microbrewery in 2019 specializing in bourbon barrel-aged stouts. Despite raising $200,000 in equity and experiencing strong sales of $145,000 in the first year, the company's bank balance declined from $200,000 to $80,000, causing investor concern. The case explores the distinction between cash position and actual business performance through proper financial statement preparation.

## Central Problem/Decision

### The Question
> How can Mira demonstrate that the brewery's actual performance is better than what the declining bank balance suggests, and what do proper financial statements reveal about the business's true health?

### Constraints

### My Participation

- **Cold Called**: [Not tracked]

### Key Insights from Discussion

#### Inventory Accounting Method
- **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** highlighted as significant for brewery operations
- Different accounting choices dramatically affect reported profits and cash flows
- Particularly important given seasonal ingredient purchases and fluctuating raw material costs
- Choice between LIFO/FIFO impacts tax obligations and reported margins

#### Manufacturing Cost Structure
- Mira's operates as a manufacturing business with complex inventory requirements
- Three-stage inventory process: Raw Materials → Work in Process → Finished Goods
- All production costs capitalized in WIP (product costs) following Matching Principle
- Non-production costs (SG&A) expensed as period costs
- Understanding this distinction critical for accurate financial reporting

#### Cash Flow vs. Profitability
- Declining cash balance doesn't reflect true operational performance
- Timing differences between cash flows and revenue recognition create disconnect
- Inventory building consumes cash but represents future revenue potential
- Accounts receivable ($45,000) represents earned but uncollected revenue
- Working capital requirements typical for growing manufacturing businesses

### Alternative Perspectives
- Some argued for conservative inventory valuation given ingredient price volatility
- Discussion on whether recipe should be recorded as intangible asset on balance sheet
- Debate on appropriate depreciation schedules for specialized brewing equipment
- Questions about contingent liabilities for unfulfilled orders

### Professor's Takeaways
- Financial statements tell different stories: Balance Sheet (position), Income Statement (performance), Cash Flow (liquidity)
- Accrual accounting provides clearer picture of business performance than cash accounting
- Manufacturing businesses require careful attention to inventory accounting and cost allocation
- Understanding the relationship between statements (articulation) essential for complete financial analysis

## Personal Reflections & Key Takeaways

### Synthesis of Learning

1. **Cash ≠ Profit**: The fundamental distinction between cash position and business performance became clear through Mira's situation. While her bank balance declined by $120,000, the business likely showed accounting profit due to strong sales and proper matching of revenues with expenses. This explains why many profitable startups still face cash crunches during growth phases.

2. **Inventory as Investment, Not Loss**: The class discussion reframed inventory buildup from a cash drain to a strategic investment. Mira's remaining ingredients ($18,750) and the systematic flow through RM→WIP→FG represents value creation, not value destruction. The LIFO discussion highlighted how accounting choices can optimize both tax positions and reported performance.

3. **Financial Statement Articulation**: Professor Baik's emphasis on how the three statements interconnect revolutionized my understanding. The Balance Sheet captures a moment, the Income Statement explains the change in retained earnings, and the Cash Flow Statement bridges the gap between accrual profit and cash reality. Mira's case perfectly illustrated why all three are necessary for complete understanding.

4. **Manufacturing Complexity**: The distinction between product costs (capitalized) and period costs (expensed) clarifies why Mira's business model requires patient capital. Every dollar spent on production increases asset value until sale, while SG&A immediately hits the income statement. This timing difference is crucial for evaluating manufacturing startups.

### Applications to Future Situations
- When evaluating startups, look beyond bank balances to understand true performance
- Consider working capital requirements when planning business growth
- Recognize that inventory accounting methods can significantly impact reported results
- Understand that healthy businesses can have cash flow challenges during growth

### Questions for Further Research
- How would different inventory valuation methods (LIFO vs. FIFO vs. weighted average) affect Mira's reported profits?
- What are the optimal working capital ratios for craft breweries?
- How do seasonal sales patterns affect cash flow management in beverage businesses?
- What are typical asset turnover ratios for successful microbreweries?
