# Reading 5: Assets and Expenses

## Overview
This reading covers the comprehensive accounting for assets (the resources owned by a company) and their relationship to expenses. It explores how assets are recorded, valued, depreciated, and ultimately converted to expenses, using Coca-Cola's 2014 annual report as a practical example.

## Asset Definition and Characteristics

### Asset Definition
**Definition**: "Probable future economic benefits obtained or controlled by a particular entity as a result of past transactions or events"

**Four Key Characteristics**:
- **Measurable cost**: Obtained at a quantifiable amount
- **Future benefit**: Likely to generate cash flow directly or indirectly
- **Control**: Entity on whose balance sheet it appears controls it
- **Past transaction**: Event giving control has already occurred

### Fundamental Equation
```
Assets = Liabilities + Equity
```

## Current Assets

### Cash and Cash Equivalents
- **Cash**: On hand and demand deposits
- **Cash equivalents**: Highly liquid short-term investments
  - Money market funds, government securities, CDs
  - Maturity < 3 months
  - High quality, minimal risk

### Accounts Receivable
- Credit sales creating promise of future payment
- Recorded at expected amount (gross price - discounts - allowances)
- **Contra asset**: Allowance for doubtful accounts

#### Bad Debt Accounting
**Estimation Methods**:
1. **Percentage of sales**: Apply historical bad debt % to current sales
2. **Percentage of receivables**: Maintain allowance at % of A/R balance
3. **Aging analysis**: Different rates for different age buckets
   - 0-30 days: Lower %
   - 31-60 days: Medium %
   - >60 days: Higher %

**Bad Debt Allowance Formula**:
```
Beginning Allowance + Bad Debt Expense - Write-offs = Ending Allowance
```

### Inventory
**Categories**:
- Finished goods (ready for sale)
- Work in process (being manufactured)
- Raw materials and supplies

#### Recording Basis
- Initially at **cost** (all costs to bring to current condition/location)
- Maintained at **lower of cost or market (LCM)**
- Market = replacement cost within NRV bounds
- **Net Realizable Value (NRV)** = Selling price - completion/selling costs

#### Cost Flow Assumptions
1. **FIFO (First-In, First-Out)**
   - Oldest items sold first
   - Ending inventory at recent costs
   - Better balance sheet value

2. **Average Cost**
   - Total cost ÷ units available
   - Smooths price fluctuations

3. **LIFO (Last-In, First-Out)**
   - Most recent items sold first
   - US GAAP only (prohibited under IFRS)
   - Tax advantages in inflation
   - Requires LIFO reserve disclosure

#### Inventory Methods
- **Perpetual**: Real-time updates as transactions occur
- **Periodic**: End-of-period reconciliation

**Cost of Goods Sold Formula**:
```
Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory = COGS
```

### Other Current Assets
- **Prepaid expenses**: Future benefits paid in advance
- **Current portion of investments**

## Long-Lived Assets

### Property, Plant & Equipment (PP&E)

#### Initial Recording
**Cost includes**:
- Purchase price (including duties, taxes)
- Direct setup costs (delivery, installation, testing)
- Estimated retirement costs
- Capitalized interest during construction

**Subsequent expenditures**:
- **Capitalize** if: Extends life, increases efficiency/productivity
- **Expense** if: Maintains current condition (repairs/maintenance)

#### Depreciation
Systematic allocation of depreciable cost over useful life

**Key Factors**:
- **Cost**: Purchase price + setup costs
- **Residual/salvage value**: Expected value at end of life
- **Useful life**: Period of expected benefit

**Common Methods**:

1. **Straight-Line**
   ```
   Annual Depreciation = (Cost - Salvage Value) / Useful Life
   ```

2. **Double-Declining Balance**
   ```
   Rate = 2 × (1 / Useful Life)
   Annual Depreciation = Net Book Value × Rate
   ```

3. **Sum-of-Years'-Digits**
   ```
   Fraction = Remaining Life / Sum of Years
   Annual Depreciation = Depreciable Cost × Fraction
   ```

4. **Units of Production**
   ```
   Rate per Unit = Depreciable Cost / Total Expected Units
   Annual Depreciation = Units Produced × Rate per Unit
   ```

**Net Book Value Formula**:
```
Asset Cost - Accumulated Depreciation = Net Book Value
```

#### Special Categories
- **Land**: No depreciation (indefinite life)
- **Wasting assets**: Natural resources subject to depletion

### Deferred Tax Assets/Liabilities
- Timing differences between book and tax accounting
- Example: Bad debt provisions (book expense, not tax deductible until realized)

### Investments

#### Debt Securities Classification
1. **Held-to-Maturity**: Amortized cost
2. **Trading**: Fair value, gains/losses to income
3. **Available-for-Sale**: Fair value, gains/losses to OCI

#### Equity Securities
- **<20% ownership**: Minority passive (fair value or cost)
- **20-50% ownership**: Equity method
- **>50% ownership**: Consolidation

### Goodwill and Intangibles

#### Goodwill
- Acquisition price exceeding fair value of net identifiable assets
- Not amortized, tested annually for impairment
- Private companies option: 10-year amortization (US GAAP only)

**Goodwill Calculation**:
```
Purchase Price - Fair Value of Net Identifiable Assets = Goodwill
```

#### Other Intangibles
**Finite life**: Amortized over economic/legal life (max 40 years)
**Indefinite life**: Not amortized, annual impairment test

**Internal Development**:
- **R&D costs**: 
  - US GAAP: Expense immediately
  - IFRS: Capitalize development when feasible
- **Software development**: Capitalize after feasibility established
- **Patents**: Only legal/registration costs if internally developed

## Asset Valuation Adjustments

### Revaluation
- **US GAAP**: Not allowed for PP&E
- **IFRS**: Allowed with gains to OCI

### Impairment
**Impairment Test**:
```
If Carrying Value > Expected Future Cash Flows (undiscounted)
Then write down to Fair Value
```

## Key US GAAP vs IFRS Differences

| Topic | US GAAP | IFRS |
|-------|---------|------|
| PP&E Revaluation | Not allowed | Allowed |
| Component Depreciation | Allowed but uncommon | Required in some cases |
| LIFO Inventory | Allowed | Prohibited |
| Development Costs | Expense | Capitalize when feasible |

## Relationship to Income Statement

### Key Definitions
- **Expenditure**: Cash outlay (may become asset)
- **Expense**: Resource consumed to generate revenue

### Key Connections
1. **A/R and Revenue**: Credit sales create receivables
2. **Inventory and COGS**: Sold inventory becomes expense
3. **PP&E and Depreciation**: Annual allocation to expense
4. **Intangibles and Amortization**: Systematic expense recognition

### Other Asset-Related Income Items
- Unrealized gains/losses (trading securities)
- Bad debt provisions
- Asset sale gains/losses
- Inventory write-downs
- Asset impairments

## Analytical Considerations

### Key Metrics
- **Liquidity**: Current ratio, quick ratio
- **Efficiency**: Asset turnover, inventory turns
- **Quality**: Days sales outstanding, allowance trends

### Red Flags
- A/R growing faster than sales
- Inventory buildup without sales growth
- Frequent asset write-downs
- Changes in depreciation methods/estimates
- Large off-balance sheet commitments

### Quality Assessment
- Conservative vs aggressive accounting choices
- Cash flow vs reported earnings alignment
- Comparison to industry practices
- Footnote disclosures analysis

## Practical Applications

### For Management
- Optimize working capital
- Balance growth investments with cash generation
- Monitor asset utilization metrics
- Implement strong internal controls

### For Analysts
- Assess earnings quality through asset analysis
- Track working capital efficiency
- Identify manipulation risks
- Adjust for aggressive accounting

### For Auditors
- Test existence and valuation assertions
- Verify ownership and control
- Review impairment analyses
- Confirm receivables and inventory counts

## Summary
Assets represent future economic benefits and form the productive base of a company. Understanding how they are initially recorded, subsequently valued, and ultimately converted to expenses is crucial for financial analysis. The choice of accounting methods (FIFO vs LIFO, depreciation methods, capitalization policies) significantly impacts reported results. Always examine the relationship between asset values, expense recognition, and cash flows to assess true economic performance.
