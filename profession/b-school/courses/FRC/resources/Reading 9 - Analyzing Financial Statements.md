# Reading 9: Analyzing Financial Statements

## Overview
This reading introduces financial analysis tools for understanding business models and assessing performance. It primarily uses the DuPont framework for ratio analysis, demonstrating how different ratios reveal insights about operational efficiency, profitability, and financial leverage. Examples use retail companies including Inditex (Zara), Prada, Gap, Nordstrom, and Urban Outfitters.

## The Financial Analysis Framework

### Key Financial Statements
- **Income Statement**: Documents financial activity over a period
- **Balance Sheet**: Shows financial position at a specific date
- **Statement of Cash Flows**: Presents cash flows over a period

### Convention for Ratio Calculations
- Use **average balance sheet amounts** when comparing to income statement items
- Average = (Beginning + Ending) / 2
- Rationale: Income statement items occur throughout the year

## DuPont Framework Decomposition

### DuPont ROE Formula
```
ROE = Net Profit Margin × Asset Turnover × Financial Leverage
```

**Expanded Form**:
```
ROE = (Net Income/Sales) × (Sales/Total Assets) × (Total Assets/Equity)
```

**Simplified Form**:
```
ROE = Net Income / Equity
```

### Three Components of Performance

#### 1. Profitability (Net Profit Margin)
```
Net Profit Margin = Net Income / Sales
```
- Measures profit per dollar of sales after all expenses
- Reflects pricing strategy and cost structure

#### 2. Operating Efficiency (Asset Turnover)
```
Asset Turnover = Sales / Average Total Assets
```
- Measures sales generated per dollar of assets
- Reflects business model efficiency

#### 3. Financial Leverage (Equity Multiplier)
```
Equity Multiplier = Total Assets / Equity
```
- Measures impact of debt financing
- Higher leverage amplifies returns (and risks)

## Profitability Analysis

### Net Profit Margin
- **Formula**: Net Income / Sales
- **Interpretation**: Profit per dollar of revenue
- **Example**: Prada 12.7% vs Urban Outfitters 7.0%
  - Luxury brands: Higher margins, lower volume
  - Fast fashion: Lower margins, higher volume

### Gross Profit Margin
```
Gross Profit Margin = (Sales - COGS) / Sales
```
- Profit before operating expenses
- **Example**: Prada 71.8% vs Urban Outfitters 35.4%

### SG&A Margin
```
SG&A Margin = SG&A Expenses / Sales
```
- Operating expense efficiency
- **Example**: Prada 48.3% vs Urban Outfitters 24.4%

## Operating Efficiency Metrics

### Asset Turnover
```
Asset Turnover = Sales / Average Total Assets
```
- Sales per dollar of assets
- **Example**: Gap 2.1 vs Prada 0.8

### Return on Assets (ROA)
```
ROA = Net Income / Average Total Assets
     = Net Profit Margin × Asset Turnover
```
- Profitability relative to total resources
- **Example**: Prada 10.4% vs Urban Outfitters 11.3%

### Long-Term Asset Turnover
```
LT Asset Turnover = Sales / Average Long-Term Assets
```
- Efficiency of fixed asset utilization

## Working Capital Management

### Inventory Management

#### Inventory Turnover
```
Inventory Turnover = COGS / Average Inventory
```
- How often inventory sells per year
- **Example**: Urban Outfitters 6.4× vs Prada 1.8×

#### Days Inventory Held
```
Days Inventory = 365 / Inventory Turnover
```
- Average days inventory held before sale
- **Example**: Urban Outfitters 57 days vs Prada 201 days

### Receivables Management

#### Accounts Receivable Turnover
```
AR Turnover = Sales / Average Accounts Receivable
```
- Collection efficiency

#### Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)
```
DSO = 365 / AR Turnover
```
- Average collection period
- **Example**: Most retailers <10 days; Nordstrom 61 days (credit cards)

### Payables Management

#### Accounts Payable Turnover
```
AP Turnover = Purchases / Average Accounts Payable
```
**Where**: Purchases = COGS + Ending Inventory - Beginning Inventory

#### Days Payable Outstanding (DPO)
```
DPO = 365 / AP Turnover
```
- Days to pay suppliers
- **Example**: Inditex 115 days vs Urban Outfitters 24 days

### Cash Conversion Cycle Formula
```
CCC = Days Inventory + DSO - DPO
```
- Time between paying suppliers and collecting from customers
- **Negative CCC**: Company collects before paying suppliers
- **Example**: Inditex -22 days vs Prada 116 days

### Working Capital Turnover
```
Working Capital Turnover = Sales / Average Working Capital
```
**Where**: Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities

## Financial Leverage Analysis

### Equity Multiplier
```
Equity Multiplier = Total Assets / Equity
```
- Measure of financial leverage
- >1 indicates debt usage
- **Example**: Nordstrom 3.9 vs Prada 1.5

### Leverage Benefits & Risks
**Benefits**:
- Amplifies returns when ROA > cost of debt
- Tax-deductible interest expense
- Larger asset base for operations

**Risks**:
- Fixed interest obligations
- Financial distress risk
- Amplifies losses in downturns

### Debt-to-Equity Ratio
```
Leverage Ratio = Total Liabilities / Shareholders' Equity
```
- Alternative leverage measure
- **Example**: Nordstrom 2.9 vs Prada 0.5

### Long-Term Leverage
```
LT Leverage Ratio = Long-Term Liabilities / Equity
```
- Focus on long-term debt burden

## Solvency & Liquidity Ratios

### Interest Coverage Ratio
```
Interest Coverage = EBIT / Interest Expense
```
- Ability to meet interest obligations
- **Example**: Prada 54× vs Nordstrom 11×
- Higher ratio = lower default risk

### Current Ratio
```
Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
```
- Short-term liquidity measure
- Target often ~2.0
- **Example**: All retailers 1.7-2.3

### Quick Ratio (Acid Test)
```
Quick Ratio = (Cash + Marketable Securities + AR) / Current Liabilities
```
- Liquidity excluding inventory
- More conservative than current ratio
- **Example**: Most retailers ~1.0

## Practical Applications

### Comparative Analysis Example: Prada vs Urban Outfitters

| Metric | Prada | Urban Outfitters | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|------------------|----------------|
| **ROE** | 15.8% | 15.4% | Similar overall returns |
| **Net Margin** | 12.7% | 7.0% | Prada: luxury pricing |
| **Asset Turnover** | 0.8× | 1.6× | UO: faster asset utilization |
| **ROA** | 10.4% | 11.3% | Effects offset |
| **Leverage** | 1.5× | 1.4× | Similar capital structure |
| **Inventory Days** | 201 | 57 | Different business models |
| **Cash Cycle** | 116 days | 39 days | UO more efficient |

### Key Insights
1. **Different paths to similar ROE**: High margin/low turnover vs low margin/high turnover
2. **Business model drives ratios**: Luxury vs fast fashion
3. **Leverage amplifies returns**: Nordstrom's high ROE despite lower ROA

## Analysis Best Practices

### Ratio Selection
