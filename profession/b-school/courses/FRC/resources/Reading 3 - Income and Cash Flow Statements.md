# Reading 3: Income and Cash Flow Statements

## Overview
This reading explores the two key performance statements that show how a company performs over time: the income statement (showing profitability) and the cash flow statement (showing cash generation). Uses Ashmont Cycles and Daimler AG as examples.

## The Income Statement

### Purpose and Foundation
- Shows operating performance during an accounting period
- Based on accrual accounting: Revenue/expense recognition ≠ cash flow
- Matching concept critical: Expenses matched to revenues they generate
- Does NOT focus on cash, focuses on economic performance

### Revenue Recognition (New Standards)
**Core Principle**: Recognize revenue when control of goods/services passes to customer
- **Control**: Customer can influence use of goods/services
- **Amount**: Expected payment for transferred goods/services
- Joint FASB/IASB standard based on contracts-with-customers model

#### Recognition Criteria
1. **Earned**: Customer received good/service
2. **Realized/Realizable**: Customer paid or expected to pay
3. **Control transferred**: Ability to direct use passed to customer

### Deferred Revenue
When cash received BEFORE delivery:
- Creates **liability** (obligation to deliver)
- Cannot recognize revenue until earned
- Common in subscription/prepaid models

### Income Statement Structure

#### Standard Format (Top to Bottom)
```
Sales/Revenue
- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
= Gross Profit
- Operating Expenses (SG&A)
= Operating Income
+ Other Income
- Other Expenses (including interest)
= Income Before Taxes
- Income Tax Expense
= Income from Continuing Operations
± Discontinued Operations (net of tax)
± Extraordinary Items (eliminated after 2015)
= Net Income
```

### Key Components

#### Revenue Categories
- **Product Revenue**: From tangible goods sold
- **Service Revenue**: From services provided
- Both reported net of returns, discounts, allowances

#### Expense Categories
- **COGS**: Direct costs of products/services sold
- **SG&A (Operating Expenses)**: Period costs not directly tied to production
  - Selling expenses
  - General administrative costs
  - Marketing, management salaries
- **Interest Expense**: Cost of borrowed funds
- **Income Tax**: Current year tax + deferred tax changes

#### Profitability Metrics
- **Gross Profit**: Revenue - COGS (shows markup)
- **Operating Income**: Profit from normal operations
- **Net Income**: Bottom line after all items

### Expense Recognition

#### Matching Principle Requirements
- **Direct matching**: COGS matched to specific sales
- **Period matching**: Operating expenses matched to time period
- **Systematic allocation**: Depreciation, amortization over useful life

#### Non-Cash Expenses
- **Depreciation/Amortization**: Allocation of asset cost
- **Bad debt expense**: Estimated uncollectibles
- **Accruals**: Expenses incurred but not yet paid

### Earnings Per Share (EPS)

#### Basic EPS
```
(Net Income - Preferred Dividends) / Weighted Average Common Shares
```

#### Diluted EPS
- Assumes all convertible securities converted
- Shows potential dilution from options, warrants, convertible debt
- More conservative measure

### "Above the Line" vs "Below the Line"
- **Above**: Continuing operations (recurring)
- **Below**: Discontinued operations, extraordinary items (non-recurring)
- Stakeholders focus on "above the line" for ongoing performance

## The Statement of Cash Flows

### Purpose and Importance
- Shows sources and uses of cash during period
- Cash = lifeblood: Company needs cash to survive regardless of profit
- Only account with dedicated statement due to critical importance
- Reconciles beginning to ending cash balance

### Three Activity Categories

#### 1. Operating Activities
Cash from day-to-day business operations:
- Customer collections
- Payments to suppliers
- Payments for expenses
- Interest and tax payments

#### 2. Investing Activities
Cash for long-term asset transactions:
- Purchase of PP&E (negative)
- Sale of assets (positive)
- Acquisitions (negative)
- Investment purchases/sales

#### 3. Financing Activities
Cash from capital structure changes:
- Borrowing/repaying debt
- Issuing/repurchasing stock
- Dividend payments
- Capital contributions

### Two Preparation Methods

| Method | Direct | Indirect (Preferred) |
|--------|--------|---------------------|
| Starting Point | Actual cash transactions | Net Income |
| Approach | Lists specific receipts/payments | Removes non-cash items |
| Usage | Rarely used | Most common |
| GAAP/IFRS | Allowed | Required reconciliation |

#### Direct Method Formula
```
Cash collections from customers
- Cash paid to suppliers
- Cash paid for operating expenses
= Cash from Operating Activities
```

### Indirect Method Reconciliation

#### Operating Activities Formula
```
Net Income
+ Non-cash expenses (depreciation, amortization)
+ Losses on asset sales
- Gains on asset sales
+ Decreases in current assets (except cash)
- Increases in current assets
+ Increases in current liabilities
- Decreases in current liabilities
= Cash Flow from Operating Activities
```

#### Key Adjustments
1. **Add back non-cash expenses**: Depreciation, amortization
2. **Working capital changes**:
   - ↓ A/R = + (collected cash)
   - ↑ Inventory = - (used cash)
   - ↑ A/P = + (delayed payment)
3. **Remove non-operating items**: Gains/losses on asset sales

### Cash Flow Analysis

#### Typical Patterns
- **Healthy mature company**: 
  - Positive operating CF
  - Negative investing CF (growth investments)
  - Variable financing CF
- **Growing company**:
  - May have negative total CF due to investments
  - Operating CF should be positive
- **Troubled company**:
  - Negative operating CF
  - Positive investing CF (asset sales)
  - Struggling for financing

#### Red Flags
- Operating CF < Net Income consistently
- Negative operating CF with positive net income
- Financing activities keeping company afloat
- Declining cash despite profits

## Statement of Retained Earnings

### Format
```
Beginning Retained Earnings
+ Net Income
- Dividends Declared
= Ending Retained Earnings
```

### Purpose
- Links income statement to balance sheet
- Shows cumulative profits retained
- Tracks equity growth through earnings

## Interrelationship of Statements

### Key Connections
1. **Net Income** → Flows to Retained Earnings → Balance Sheet
2. **Cash from Operations** starts with Net Income (indirect method)
3. **Ending Cash** on Cash Flow Statement = Cash on Balance Sheet
4. **Depreciation** on Income Statement = Added back on Cash Flow Statement

### Integrated Analysis Questions
- Is the company profitable? (Income Statement)
- Is it generating cash? (Cash Flow Statement)
- How is it financing growth? (All three statements)
- Is working capital managed well? (Balance Sheet + Cash Flow)

## Critical Distinctions

### Profit vs Cash Flow
- **Profit**: Economic performance (accrual basis)
- **Cash Flow**: Actual cash movement
- Can be profitable but cash-poor
- Can have losses but positive cash flow

### Why Both Statements Matter
- **Income Statement**: Shows economic viability
- **Cash Flow Statement**: Shows liquidity and solvency
- Together provide complete performance picture

## Modern Developments

### Technology Impact
- Real-time financial reporting
- Automated revenue recognition
- Continuous close processes
- XBRL reporting standards

### Emerging Issues
- Digital revenue streams
- Subscription model accounting
- Multi-element arrangements
- Variable consideration

## Footnote Disclosures

### Required Disclosures Include
- Significant accounting policies
- Revenue recognition methods
- Debt details and maturity schedules
- Tax reconciliations
- PP&E aging and depreciation
- Pension/benefit obligations
- Commitments and contingencies
- Related party transactions
- Fair value measurements

### Importance
- Provide context for numbers
- Explain estimates and judgments
- Reveal off-balance sheet items
- Critical for complete analysis

## Key Analytical Takeaways

1. **Always analyze both statements together** - profit without cash is unsustainable
2. **Focus on operating activities** - core business must generate cash
3. **Watch for timing games** - revenue acceleration, expense deferral
4. **Compare cash flow to net income** - large gaps signal issues
5. **Understand non-cash items** - depreciation, amortization, accruals
6. **Track working capital efficiency** - days sales outstanding, inventory turns
7. **Assess quality of earnings** - recurring vs. one-time items
8. **Monitor cash burn rate** - especially for growth companies
9. **Read the footnotes** - critical details not in statements
10. **Consider industry context** - normal patterns vary by sector

## Practical Applications

### For Management
- Monitor cash conversion cycle
- Manage working capital actively
- Balance growth with cash generation
- Plan for seasonal fluctuations

### For Investors
- Assess earnings quality
- Evaluate cash generation ability
- Identify manipulation risks
- Compare to industry peers

### For Creditors

- Monitor liquidity trends
- Evaluate collateral values

## Common Pitfalls

### In Analysis
- Focusing only on net income
- Ignoring cash flow trends
- Missing working capital changes
- Overlooking non-recurring items

### In Preparation
- Aggressive revenue recognition
- Inadequate bad debt reserves
- Improper expense capitalization
- Insufficient disclosures
