# Reading 12: Corporate Governance

## Overview
This reading explores corporate governance - the set of mechanisms and systems by which companies are directed and controlled. It focuses on for-profit businesses owned by dispersed private investors, examining two fundamental conflicts of interest: owner-manager conflicts and intra-shareholder conflicts. The reading covers various governance mechanisms including corporate law, boards, compensation contracts, institutional investors, and market pressures.

## Historical Context
Corporate governance disputes date back centuries:
- **1609**: Dutch East India Company shareholder complaints about capital misuse
- **2013**: Apple shareholder rebellion demanding better use of $137 billion cash reserves
- Evolution from simple owner disputes to complex multi-stakeholder governance systems

## What Is Corporate Governance?

### Corporate Governance Definition
**Definition**: Corporate governance encompasses the components of systems by which companies are directed and controlled, varying by:
- Country and legal system
- Time period
- Company type, size, and ownership structure

### Multiple Perspectives
- **Economic View**: How investors obtain returns for financing companies
- **Agency Theory**: Managing conflicts between principals and agents
- **Organizational View**: Oversight and management of large organizations
- **Political View**: Enhancing legitimacy of private companies
- **Accounting View**: Information mechanisms for investment decisions and performance monitoring

## Two Core Conflicts of Interest

### 1. Owner-Manager Conflicts
**Definition**: Conflicts between dispersed equity owners and senior management
- Managers may pursue personal goals over shareholder value
- Information asymmetry between managers and owners
- Risk preferences may differ (managers more risk-averse)

### 2. Intra-Shareholder Conflicts
**Definition**: Conflicts between controlling and non-controlling shareholders
- Controlling shareholders may extract private benefits
- Minority shareholders face expropriation risks
- Common in companies with concentrated ownership

## Ownership Patterns Worldwide

### Dispersed Ownership Model
- Common in: US, UK, Australia
- Characteristics: No single controlling shareholder
- Main conflict: Owner-manager agency problems
- Example: Microsoft (1995) - Gates 23.7%, Allen 9%, Ballmer 5%

### Concentrated Ownership Model
- Common in: Continental Europe, Asia, Latin America
- Characteristics: Single controlling owner/family
- Main conflict: Controlling vs. minority shareholders
- Example: Barrick Gold - pyramidal structure through Horsham Corporation

## Mechanisms for Mitigating Owner-Manager Conflicts

### 1. Corporate Law
**Key Elements**:
- **Fiduciary Duties**: Duty of care and duty of loyalty
- **Business Judgment Rule**: Protects directors from liability for honest mistakes
- **Shareholder Rights**: Voting, inspection, litigation
- **State Competition**: Delaware dominance in US corporate law

### 2. Securities Law and Stock Exchange Standards
**SEC Requirements**:
- Periodic disclosure (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K)
- Proxy statements for shareholder meetings
- Insider trading restrictions
- Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2002) requirements

**Stock Exchange Rules**:
- Independent director requirements
- Audit committee standards
- Compensation committee requirements
- Corporate governance guidelines

### 3. Boards of Directors
**Functions**:

- Set executive compensation
- Approve major transactions
- Ensure compliance

**Board Composition Trends**:
- Increased independence (majority independent directors)
- Separation of CEO/Chairman roles
- Diversity initiatives
- Specialized committees (audit, compensation, nominating)

### 4. Compensation Contracts
**Alignment Mechanisms**:
- **Equity-based compensation**: Stock options, restricted stock
- **Performance metrics**: ROE, TSR, EPS targets
- **Vesting schedules**: Time-based and performance-based
- **Clawback provisions**: Recovery of compensation for misconduct

**Challenges**:
- Short-termism risks
- Gaming of metrics
- Excessive risk-taking incentives
- Say-on-pay votes (advisory)

### 5. Institutional Investors
**Types**:
- Pension funds (CalPERS, CalSTRS)
- Mutual funds (Vanguard, BlackRock, Fidelity)
- Hedge funds (activist investors)
- Sovereign wealth funds

**Engagement Methods**:

### 6. Intermediaries
**Proxy Advisory Firms**:
- ISS (Institutional Shareholder Services)
- Glass Lewis
- Provide voting recommendations
- Influence ~25-40% of shareholder votes

**Auditors**:
- Big Four dominance (PwC, EY, Deloitte, KPMG)
- Independence requirements
- PCAOB oversight
- Audit committee relationship

**Rating Agencies**:
- Credit ratings affect cost of capital
- Governance ratings emerging
- ESG considerations increasing

### 7. Market Pressures

#### Product Market Competition
- Competitive pressure improves efficiency
- Bankruptcy threat disciplines managers
- Industry benchmarking

#### Labor Market for Executives
- Reputation effects
- Career concerns

- State anti-takeover laws

## Mechanisms for Mitigating Intra-Shareholder Conflicts

### Control-Enhancing Mechanisms
**Methods to Maintain Control**:
- **Dual-Class Shares**: Different voting rights (e.g., Class A: 1 vote, Class B: 10 votes)
- **Pyramidal Structures**: Control through chain of companies
- **Cross-Shareholdings**: Circular ownership patterns
- **Golden Shares**: Special government rights

### Protection Mechanisms
**Legal Protections**:
- Minority shareholder rights
- Related-party transaction rules
- Mandatory bid rules (Europe)
- Appraisal rights
- Class action lawsuits

**Market Solutions**:
- Independent director approval
- Majority-of-minority votes
- Fair value opinions
- Tag-along rights

## Recent Governance Trends

## Key Takeaways

1. **Corporate governance is multifaceted**: Legal, market, and social mechanisms all play roles

2. **No one-size-fits-all solution**: Governance mechanisms vary by context and ownership structure

3. **Trade-offs exist**: Mechanisms that solve one problem may create others

4. **Evolution is constant**: Governance practices adapt to new challenges and opportunities

5. **Global convergence is limited**: National differences persist despite globalization

6. **Effectiveness depends on implementation**: Good governance requires more than just rules

7. **Multiple stakeholders matter**: Even shareholder-focused governance must consider broader impacts

## Contemporary Challenges

### Short-Termism
- Quarterly earnings pressure
- Stock buybacks vs. R&D investment
- Long-term value creation metrics

### Executive Compensation

- Pay-performance sensitivity
- Peer group manipulation

### Board Effectiveness
- Director overboarding
- Skill set requirements (cyber, ESG)
- Board refreshment vs. experience

### Shareholder Activism

## Conclusion
Corporate governance remains a dynamic field addressing fundamental questions about corporate purpose, accountability, and control. While mechanisms have evolved significantly from the Dutch East India Company's bacon-smeared books, the core challenge remains: aligning the interests of those who provide capital with those who manage it, while considering broader stakeholder impacts. Success requires understanding both the universal principles and contextual variations that shape governance practices worldwide.
