# Reading 1: Basic Accounting Concepts and Assumptions

## Overview
This reading establishes the fundamental framework that underlies all financial accounting and reporting. These concepts guide standard-setting organizations (FASB/IASB), preparers of financial statements, and users in understanding financial information.

## Key Distinction
- **Basic Concepts**: Broad framework defining the value and limitations of financial statements
- **Accounting Standards (US GAAP/IFRS)**: Specific guidance for individual transactions and events

## The 12 Basic Accounting Concepts

### 1. Business Entity
**Definition**: Financial statements represent a business entity separate and distinct from its owners
- Sets boundaries for what's included in financial reports
- Critical for small businesses where personal/business assets may be intermingled

### 2. Going Concern
**Definition**: Default assumption that entity will continue operations indefinitely
- Affects asset valuation (e.g., accounts receivable at face value, not liquidation value)
- Must disclose if entity has limited life or approaching liquidation
- Does NOT imply future = past

### 3. Monetary Unit
**Definition**: Only records events measurable in monetary terms
- Must indicate currency used (USD, EUR, etc.)
- **Limitations**:
  - Cannot capture qualitative factors (employee morale, competitive advantage)
  - US GAAP doesn't adjust for inflation; IFRS allows inflation adjustments

### 4. Historical Cost
**Definition**: Transactions initially recorded at actual cost (easily documented)
- Creates "mixed attributes" model:
  - Nonmonetary assets (PP&E): Usually at historical cost
  - Monetary assets (marketable securities): Often at current/fair value
- Modifications allowed for inventory (lower of cost or market), donated assets, IFRS revaluation model

### 5. Accounting Period
**Definition**: Breaks continuous business activity into discrete periods (usually 12 months)
- Fiscal year may differ from calendar year based on business cycle
- Creates challenges for allocating long-term costs and multi-period contracts

### 6. Consistency
**Definition**: Same accounting methods used for similar transactions over time
- Changes allowed when justified by circumstances
- Does NOT require uniformity across companies or divisions
- Critical for period-to-period comparability

### 7. Matching
**Definition**: Income equals revenues matched with related costs of the period
- "Effort (costs) and Accomplishments (revenues)"
- Requires accrual accounting (not cash basis)
- May defer recognition to future periods when benefits occur

### 8. Dual Aspect
**Definition**: Foundation of double-entry bookkeeping where every transaction affects at least two items

**Fundamental Equation**:
```
Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders' Equity
```

**Key Components**:
- **Assets**: Probable future economic benefits from past transactions
- **Liabilities**: Probable future sacrifices/obligations
- **Equity**: Ownership interest (excess of assets over liabilities)

### 9. Reliability of Evidence
**Definition**: Prioritize objective, verifiable documentation over subjective judgment
- Acceptable evidence: invoices, bank statements, contracts, receipts
- Auditors rely on audit trails and internal controls
- Sarbanes-Oxley requires management assessment of internal controls

### 10. Disclosure
**Definition**: Provide enough information to avoid misleading informed readers
- Special disclosure for:
  - Unusual items
  - Changes in expectations
  - Significant contractual relations
  - New activities
- Can appear in statements, notes, or auditor's opinion

### 11. Materiality
**Definition**: Standards apply only to material (significant) items
- **Test**: Would a well-informed reader's decision change if treated differently?
- Beware cumulative effect of immaterial items

### 12. Conservatism
**Note**: Controversial concept - FASB rejects it; practitioners often apply it
- Skepticism about incomplete transactions succeeding
- When choosing between alternatives, lean toward:
  - Lower asset values
  - Higher liability values
  - More stringent revenue recognition
- **Risk**: Can lead to understatement in one period, overstatement in another

## SFAC No. 8: Qualitative Characteristics of Useful Financial Information

### Fundamental Characteristics
1. **Relevance**: Makes a difference in decisions (predictive/confirmatory value)
2. **Faithful Representation**: Complete, neutral, and free from error

### Enhancing Characteristics
- **Comparability**: Can compare across entities and periods
- **Verifiability**: Independent observers reach consensus
- **Timeliness**: Available when needed for decisions
- **Understandability**: Clear and concise presentation

## Implications for Financial Analysis
- Concepts determine character and scope of financial data
- Mixed measurement bases require understanding what each account represents
- Historical cost â‰  market value (critical for valuations)
- Must distinguish what IS and ISN'T included in statements
- Going concern assumption doesn't guarantee future viability

## Key Takeaways
1. These concepts form the foundation, not specific rules for transactions
2. Financial statements assume readers understand these basics
3. Limitations are as important as capabilities (e.g., can't capture all economic reality)
4. Critical for proper interpretation of financial statements
5. Standards (GAAP/IFRS) are built upon these foundational concepts

## Important Note
Financial statements are presented assuming readers understand these concepts. Without this knowledge, misinterpretation is likely, especially regarding:
- Asset valuations (historical cost vs. market value)
- What economic events are/aren't captured
- The assumptions underlying the numbers presented
