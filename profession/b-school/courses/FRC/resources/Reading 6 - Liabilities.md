# Reading 6: Liabilities

## Overview
This reading explores the comprehensive accounting for liabilities - the obligations a company owes to external parties. It covers current and non-current liabilities, contingent liabilities, warranties, and special topics like leases, pensions, and deferred taxes, using Biogen Inc.'s 2015 financial statements as a practical example.

## Liability Definition

### Liability Definition
**Definition**: "Probable future sacrifices of economic benefits arising from present obligations of a particular entity to transfer assets or provide services to other entities in the future as a result of past transactions or events"

### Three Essential Conditions
- **Future transfer is probable**: Economic benefit sacrifice likely
- **Present obligation exists**: Known, measurable duty
- **Past transaction occurred**: Event already happened

### Fundamental Equation
```
Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity
```

## Current Liabilities (Due within 1 year)

### Operating Current Liabilities

#### Accounts Payable
- Amounts owed to vendors for credit purchases
- Typically 30-60 day payment terms
- Non-interest bearing unless overdue
- Trade credit minimizes cash payment needs

#### Accrued Liabilities
- Obligations for services consumed but not paid
- Examples: Wages, rent, utilities, insurance
- Interest-free like accounts payable
- Recorded as expense with corresponding liability

#### Unearned Revenue
- Deferred performance obligations
- Cash received before delivery
- Creates liability until earned
- Examples:
  - University tuition
  - Magazine subscriptions
  - Customer deposits
  - Gift cards
  - Airline miles

### Non-Operating Current Liabilities

#### Short-Term Interest-Bearing Obligations
- Lines of credit
- Revolving bank loans
- Due on demand
- Interest accrues to current liability

#### Current Portion of Long-Term Debt
- Long-term obligations due within year
- Reclassified from long-term category
- Includes principal and interest

#### Income Taxes Payable
- Federal, state, local taxes due
- Current year obligations

## Non-Current Liabilities (Due after 1 year)

### Installment Loans
- Bank/financial institution borrowing
- Predetermined repayment schedule
- Secured by specific assets
- Example: Mortgages

### Debt Instruments (Bonds)

#### Key Terms
- **Face Value**: Principal to be repaid at maturity
- **Coupon Rate**: Interest rate on face value
- **Yield/Market Rate**: Expected return demanded by investors
- **Maturity**: When principal repaid

#### Bond Pricing
**Bond trades at**:
- **Par**: Coupon rate = Market yield
- **Premium**: Coupon rate > Market yield (price > face value)
- **Discount**: Coupon rate < Market yield (price < face value)

**Bond Present Value Formula**:
```
PV = Sum of PV(Interest Payments) + PV(Face Value at Maturity)
```

#### Accounting for Bonds

**Issuance at Premium** (Market yield < Coupon rate):
```
Dr. Cash                     [Premium price]
   Cr. Bonds Payable        [Face value]
   Cr. Bond Premium         [Excess over face]
```

**Issuance at Discount** (Market yield > Coupon rate):
```
Dr. Cash                     [Discount price]
Dr. Bond Discount           [Shortfall]
   Cr. Bonds Payable        [Face value]
```

#### Effective Interest Method
- Interest expense = Carrying value × Market yield
- Amortizes premium/discount over bond life
- Premium reduces interest expense
- Discount increases interest expense

### Fair Value Option
- Alternative to historical cost
- Adjusts liability to market value
- Gains/losses to income statement
- Irrevocable choice at issuance

## Contingent Liabilities

### Recognition Criteria
Record if **BOTH** conditions met:
1. Loss is **probable**
2. Amount **reasonably estimable**

### Treatment by Likelihood

| Likelihood | Estimable | Not Estimable |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Probable** | Record liability & disclose | Disclose only |
| **Reasonably Possible** | Disclose only | Disclose only |
| **Remote** | No action | No action |

### Common Examples
- Lawsuits and legal claims
- Environmental cleanup
- Product recalls
- Restructuring obligations

## Product Warranties

### Warranty Types

#### Included Warranty (Not Separately Priced)
- Estimate fair value of guarantee
- Record warranty expense with sale
- Create warranty liability
```
Dr. Warranty Expense         $X
   Cr. Warranty Liability    $X
```

#### Extended Warranty (Separately Priced)
- Record as unearned revenue initially
- Recognize revenue over warranty period
- Match costs to revenue period
```
Dr. Cash                     $X
   Cr. Unearned Warranty Revenue  $X
```

## Lease Accounting (New Standards)

### Lease Definition
Contract conveying right to control asset use for period in exchange for consideration

### Lease Classification

#### Finance Lease (Purchase-like)
Meets ANY ONE criterion:
1. Ownership transfers at end
2. Bargain purchase option exists
3. Term ≥ 75% of economic life
4. PV payments ≥ 90% of fair value
5. Specialized asset with no alternative use

#### Operating Lease
All other leases not meeting finance criteria

### Accounting Treatment (Leases > 1 year)

**Both Types Initially**:
```
Dr. Right-of-Use Asset       [PV of payments]
   Cr. Lease Liability       [PV of payments]
```

**Finance Lease** (Explicit interest & amortization):
- Interest expense on liability
- Straight-line amortization of asset
- Front-loaded expense pattern

**Operating Lease** (Single lease expense):
- Straight-line total expense
- Implied interest and amortization
- Level expense pattern

## Pension Liabilities

### Defined Contribution Plans
- Specified contribution amounts
- No guaranteed benefits
- Simple accounting: Expense = Contribution
- Investment risk on employee

### Defined Benefit Plans
- Specified future benefits
- Complex actuarial calculations
- **Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO)** vs Plan Assets
- Funding status on balance sheet:
  - Overfunded → Asset
  - Underfunded → Liability

## Deferred Tax Liabilities
- Temporary differences between book and tax
- Future tax obligations
- Complex topic requiring specialized knowledge

## Time Value of Money

### Present Value Formula
**Single Payment Present Value**:
```
PV = FV / (1 + i)^n
```

**Bond Present Value**:
```
PV = Σ[Coupon/(1+i)^t] + Face Value/(1+i)^n
```

**Where**:
- i = interest rate
- n = number of periods
- t = specific period

## Key Analytical Considerations

### Quality Indicators
- **Conservative**: Later liability recognition
- **Aggressive**: Earlier/lower liability recording
- Compare to industry practices
- Track changes in estimates

### Red Flags
- Rapid growth in current liabilities
- Off-balance sheet obligations
- Frequent contingency charges
- Changes in warranty estimates
- Underfunded pensions

### Key Metrics
- **Current Ratio**: Current assets/Current liabilities
- **Quick Ratio**: (CA - Inventory)/CL
- **Debt-to-Equity**: Total debt/Equity
- **Debt-to-Assets**: Total debt/Assets
- **Interest Coverage**: EBIT/Interest expense

## US GAAP vs IFRS Differences

| Topic | US GAAP | IFRS |
|-------|---------|------|
| Contingencies | "Probable" threshold | "More likely than not" |
| Lease Accounting | Finance/Operating distinction | Similar approach |
| Bond Costs | Amortized separately | Netted against liability |

## Practical Applications

### For Management
- Optimize working capital
- Monitor debt covenants
- Plan refinancing needs
- Manage contingency reserves

### For Analysts
- Assess liquidity and solvency
- Evaluate off-balance sheet risks
- Adjust for aggressive accounting
- Compare to peer companies

### For Auditors
- Test existence and completeness
- Verify valuations
- Review contingency assessments
- Confirm debt agreements

## Summary
Liabilities represent obligations that will require future resource sacrifices. Understanding their classification (current vs. non-current), measurement (historical cost vs. fair value), and special characteristics (contingent, lease, pension) is crucial for financial analysis. The accounting choices made significantly impact reported leverage, liquidity, and profitability metrics. Always examine footnotes for complete understanding of a company's obligations, especially off-balance sheet items and contingencies.
