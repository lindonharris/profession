# Reading 11: Market and Regulatory Institutions

## Overview
This reading explores the market and regulatory institutions involved in accounting standard-setting in the United States and internationally. It explains how accounting rules are social constructs created through political processes rather than scientific laws, and examines the key organizations that shape financial reporting standards globally.

## Key Differences: US GAAP vs. IFRS

| Item | US GAAP | IFRS |
|------|---------|------|
| **Cash Flow Statement** | Interest/dividends in operating section | Flexible classification |
| **Contingent Liabilities** | Record if probable AND estimable | Record if probable OR possible |
| **Extraordinary Items** | Separate from continuing operations | Part of continuing operations |

| **Industry Rules** | Industry-specific guidance | No industry differences |

## Convergence Efforts

### Timeline
- 2002: Convergence project begins
- 2007: Foreign firms can use IFRS on US exchanges
- 2014: Joint revenue recognition standard
- Ongoing: Slow progress on major differences

### Challenges
- Interconnection with US law
- Corporate governance differences
- Cost of transition
- Political resistance

### Status
- Full convergence unlikely
- Focus on preventing further divergence
- Continued cooperation where possible

## Corporate Governance Role

### Corporate Governance Definition
**Definition**: "The system of rules, practices, and processes by which a company is directed and controlled"

### Key Components
- **Board of Directors**: Oversight and strategy
- **Audit Committee**: Independent directors only
- **Internal Audit**: Tests internal controls
- **External Auditors**: Independent verification
- **Management**: Day-to-day operations

### Fraud Prevention Framework
- Strong internal controls
- Effective audit committees
- Independent external auditors
- Whistleblower protections
- Ethical corporate culture

## Case Studies in Governance Failure

### WorldCom (US)
- $11 billion in misstatements
- Treated operating expenses as capital
- Internal audit discovered fraud
- Led to SOX passage

### Satyam (India)
- $1.5 billion fraud
- Fictitious customers and invoices
- Auditor (PwC) fined $7.5 million
- Partners banned from auditing

### Common Factors
- Lack of professional skepticism

## Summary
The accounting standard-setting process involves numerous market and regulatory institutions operating through complex political processes. In the US, the SEC delegates authority to FASB while maintaining oversight. Internationally, IASB sets IFRS without statutory backing, leading to varied adoption and enforcement. Corporate governance, strengthened by SOX in the US, plays a crucial role in ensuring reliable financial reporting. Understanding these institutions and their interactions is essential for properly interpreting and using financial statements.
