# Reading 8: Fair Value Measurement in Accounting

## Overview
This reading explores fair value measurement, a critical concept in modern financial accounting. It covers the framework for determining fair value, the debate between fair value and historical cost, and the practical application of fair value principles using Topic 820 (US GAAP) and IFRS 13 guidance.

## Mixed Attributes Model
- Financial statements use a **mixed attributes approach** combining:
  - **Historical cost**: Assets/liabilities at original transaction price
  - **Fair value**: Price that would be received/paid in current market transaction
- Which approach applies depends on specific accounting standards for each asset/liability class

## Fair Value Definition

### Fair Value Definition
**Definition**: "The price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date"

### Key Characteristics
- **Market-based** measurement (not entity-specific)
- Based on **exit price** (selling price), not entry price
- Assumes **orderly transaction** (not forced sale)
- Reflects **current market conditions** at measurement date

## Fair Value Framework Principles

### 1. Market Participant Perspective
- Use assumptions that market participants would use
- Consider buyers/sellers who are:
  - Independent (not related parties)
  - Knowledgeable about the asset/liability
  - Able and willing to transact (not forced)

### 2. Market-Based Measurement
- Not based on entity's specific value or intentions
- Management's views about future value are irrelevant
- Entity's intention to hold asset doesn't affect fair value

### 3. Principal or Most Advantageous Market
- **Principal market**: Greatest volume and activity level
- **Most advantageous market**: Maximizes proceeds (if no principal market)
- In absence of evidence, assume normal market for entity

### 4. Highest and Best Use (Nonfinancial Assets)
- Consider what maximizes asset value
- Must be:
  - Physically possible
  - Legally permissible
  - Financially feasible

## Valuation Techniques

### 1. Market Approach
- Uses prices from market transactions for identical/comparable items
- Example: NYSE stock prices for publicly traded securities

### 2. Income Approach
- Converts future cash flows to present value
- Uses discounted cash flow models
- Requires appropriate risk adjustments

### 3. Cost Approach
- Amount to replace asset's service capacity
- Current replacement cost basis
- Used when market/income approaches unavailable

## Fair Value Input Hierarchy

### Level 1: Quoted Prices (Most Reliable)
**Definition**: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical items
- NYSE stock prices, actively traded bonds
- Highest priority - most objective and verifiable

### Level 2: Observable Inputs
**Definition**: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable
- Prices for similar assets
- Interest rates and yield curves
- Market-corroborated inputs
- Medium priority - requires some adjustment

### Level 3: Unobservable Inputs (Least Reliable)
**Definition**: Entity-developed inputs using best available information
- Projected cash flows
- Internal models and assumptions
- Management estimates
- Lowest priority - most subjective, highest manipulation risk

## Key Measurement Considerations

### Transaction Costs vs Transportation Costs
- **Transaction costs**: Direct costs to sell/transfer (broker fees)
  - Considered for determining most advantageous market
  - NOT included in fair value measurement
- **Transportation costs**: Costs to move asset to market
  - Included if location is asset characteristic
  - Deducted from market price

### Liabilities and Credit Risk
- Fair value of liabilities includes **nonperformance risk**
- Must consider entity's own credit risk
- Deteriorating credit → Lower liability fair value

## Fair Value Option

### Purpose
- Allows entities to measure financial instruments at fair value
- Reduces accounting mismatches without complex hedge accounting
- Irrevocable choice at initial recognition

### Example Application
Bank with $100M mortgage securities (assets) and $100M matched liabilities:
- Without FV option: Asset losses recognized, liability gains not recognized
- With FV option: Both measured at fair value, offsetting impacts

## Comprehensive Income Reporting

### Comprehensive Income Formula
```
Comprehensive Income = Net Income + Other Comprehensive Income (OCI)
```

### OCI Items Include
- Unrealized gains/losses on available-for-sale securities
- Foreign currency translation adjustments
- Cash flow hedge gains/losses
- Pension/OPEB adjustments

### Presentation Options
1. **Single statement**: Combined with income statement
2. **Two statements**: Separate comprehensive income statement

## Investment Securities Classification (Topic 320)

### Trading Securities
- **Intent**: Sell in near term
- **Measurement**: Fair value through net income
- **Unrealized gains/losses**: In earnings

### Available-for-Sale Securities
- **Intent**: Not trading or held-to-maturity
- **Measurement**: Fair value through OCI
- **Unrealized gains/losses**: In OCI until realized

### Held-to-Maturity Securities
- **Intent**: Hold to maturity
- **Measurement**: Amortized cost
- **Unrealized gains/losses**: Not recognized (disclosed only)

## US GAAP vs IFRS Differences

### Property, Plant & Equipment

| Approach | US GAAP | IFRS |
|----------|---------|------|
| Historical Cost | Required | Allowed |
| Revaluation (Fair Value) | Not allowed | Allowed if reliable |

### Fair Value Standards
- **US GAAP**: Topic 820
- **IFRS**: IFRS 13
- Standards are largely converged with minor differences

## Disclosure Requirements

### Required Fair Value Disclosures
1. **Fair value hierarchy level** for each item
2. **Valuation techniques** used
3. **Significant inputs** especially Level 3
4. **Transfers between levels**
5. **Reconciliation of Level 3 changes**

### Example Disclosure Table
```
                     Total FV   Level 1   Level 2   Level 3
Short-term invest.    $14M      $14M      -         -
Gov't obligations    $112M      $35M      $77M      -
Corporate bonds       $80M      $17M      $63M      -
Real estate          $20M       -         -         $20M
```

## Financial Analysis Implications

### Benefits of Fair Value
- More relevant for decision-making
- Reflects current economic conditions
- Better comparability across entities
- Timely recognition of value changes

### Risks and Limitations
- **Level 3 inputs** highly subjective
- Potential for **management bias**
- Complexity in implementation
- Volatility in reported earnings

### Analytical Red Flags
- Heavy reliance on Level 3 inputs
- Frequent changes in valuation techniques
- Large unexplained fair value adjustments
- Inconsistent application across similar assets

## Practical Application Process (PwC Framework)

### Step 1: Determine Unit of Account
- Individual asset/liability or group

### Step 2: Identify Asset/Liability Type
- Financial vs nonfinancial
- Consider valuation premise

### Step 3: Identify Market Access
- Principal market exists?
- Develop hypothetical market if needed

### Step 4: Select Valuation Technique
- Market, income, or cost approach
- Maximize observable inputs

### Step 5: Calculate Fair Value
- Apply technique consistently
- Document assumptions and inputs

## Key Analytical Takeaways

1. **Fair value ≠ Market value** - Fair value follows specific framework
2. **Input hierarchy critical** - Level 1 most reliable, Level 3 most subjective
3. **Not always "fair"** - Can be manipulated, especially with Level 3 inputs
4. **Mixed model reality** - Most statements combine fair value and historical cost
5. **Disclosure analysis essential** - Focus on Level 3 items and changes
6. **Credit risk matters** - Affects liability fair values
7. **Complexity increases risk** - More judgment = more potential bias
8. **Industry context important** - Financial firms use fair value extensively
9. **Cash flow still king** - When in doubt, focus on cash flow statement
10. **Volatility trade-off** - Relevance vs. reliability debate continues

## Summary
Fair value measurement provides a framework for determining current market-based values for assets and liabilities. While offering more relevant information than historical cost, it requires significant judgment, especially for Level 3 inputs. Understanding the hierarchy of inputs, valuation techniques, and disclosure requirements is essential for both preparers and users of financial statements. The mixed attributes model means both fair value and historical cost coexist in modern financial reporting, requiring careful analysis to understand what each number represents.
