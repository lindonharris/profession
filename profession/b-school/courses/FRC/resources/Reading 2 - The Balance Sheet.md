# Reading 2: The Balance Sheet

## Overview
This reading explores the balance sheet as the foundation of financial reporting, demonstrating how to prepare it through transaction analysis and the accounting cycle. Uses Ashmont Cycles bike shop as a comprehensive example.

## Core Components of the Balance Sheet

### The Accounting Equation
**Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity**
- Must always balance after every transaction
- Owner's Equity = Contributed Capital + Retained Earnings
- Retained Earnings = Beginning RE + Net Income - Dividends

### Asset Categories

#### Current Assets (converted to cash within 1 year)
- **Cash and Cash Equivalents**: Most liquid assets
- **Marketable Securities**: Short-term investments
- **Accounts Receivable**: Money owed by customers
  - Net of allowance for doubtful accounts
- **Inventory**: Goods for sale
  - Manufacturing: Raw materials, WIP, finished goods
- **Prepaid Expenses**: Payments for future benefits

#### Non-Current Assets
- **Property, Plant & Equipment (PP&E)**
  - Recorded at historical cost
  - Less: Accumulated depreciation
  - Net book value shown
- **Intangible Assets**: Patents, trademarks, goodwill
- **Long-term Investments**: Strategic holdings

### Liability Categories

#### Current Liabilities (due within 1 year)
- **Accounts Payable**: Owed to suppliers
- **Accrued Expenses**: Incurred but not yet paid
- **Short-term Debt**: Including current portion of long-term debt
- **Deferred Revenue**: Cash received before service delivery

#### Long-term Liabilities
- **Long-term Debt**: Bonds, notes, mortgages
- **Pension Obligations**
- **Deferred Tax Liabilities**

### Owner's Equity Components
- **Contributed Capital**: 
  - Common stock (par value)
  - Additional paid-in capital (APIC)
- **Retained Earnings**: Cumulative profits retained
- **Treasury Stock**: (deduction) Own shares repurchased
- **Other Comprehensive Income**: Unrealized gains/losses

## The Accounting Cycle

### 1. Transaction Analysis
For each business event:
- Identify accounts affected
- Determine debit/credit impacts
- Ensure equation remains balanced

### 2. Journal Entries
**Debit/Credit Rules:**
- **Assets**: Debit to increase, Credit to decrease
- **Liabilities**: Credit to increase, Debit to decrease
- **Equity**: Credit to increase, Debit to decrease
- **Revenues**: Credit to increase (increases equity)
- **Expenses**: Debit to increase (decreases equity)

### 3. Posting to Ledger
- Transfer journal entries to T-accounts
- Calculate running balances
- Organize by account type

### 4. Trial Balance
- List all accounts with balances
- Verify total debits = total credits
- Identify any errors before statements

### 5. Adjusting Entries
**Types of Adjustments:**
- **Accruals**: Record earned but unreceived/unpaid items
- **Deferrals**: Allocate prepaid/unearned items
- **Depreciation**: Allocate asset cost over useful life
- **Bad Debt**: Estimate uncollectible receivables

### 6. Financial Statement Preparation
- Income Statement first (to calculate net income)
- Statement of Retained Earnings
- Balance Sheet
- Cash Flow Statement

### 7. Closing Entries
- Close revenue/expense accounts to retained earnings
- Reset temporary accounts for next period
- Permanent accounts carry forward

## Ashmont Cycles Example Transactions

### Initial Setup (March 1)
- $50,000 cash investment → Cash ↑ $50,000, Common Stock ↑ $50,000

### Key Operating Transactions
1. **Inventory Purchase (Credit)**: Inventory ↑ $10,000, Accounts Payable ↑ $10,000
2. **PP&E Purchase (Cash)**: Equipment ↑ $15,000, Cash ↓ $15,000
3. **Sales Transaction**:
   - Cash sale: Cash ↑ $8,000, Revenue ↑ $8,000
   - COGS: COGS ↑ $5,000, Inventory ↓ $5,000
4. **Operating Expenses**: Various Expenses ↑, Cash/Payables ↑
5. **Loan Transaction**: Cash ↑ $20,000, Notes Payable ↑ $20,000

### Month-End Adjustments
- **Depreciation**: Depreciation Expense ↑ $250, Accumulated Depreciation ↑ $250
- **Interest Accrual**: Interest Expense ↑ $100, Interest Payable ↑ $100
- **Prepaid Rent Allocation**: Rent Expense ↑ $1,000, Prepaid Rent ↓ $1,000

## Balance Sheet Analysis Techniques

### Liquidity Ratios
- **Current Ratio** = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
  - Measures short-term solvency
  - Target: > 1.0
- **Quick Ratio** = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities
  - More conservative liquidity measure

### Leverage Ratios
- **Debt-to-Equity** = Total Debt / Total Equity
  - Measures financial leverage
- **Debt-to-Assets** = Total Debt / Total Assets
  - Shows proportion financed by debt

### Efficiency Metrics
- **Asset Turnover** = Revenue / Average Total Assets
- **Working Capital** = Current Assets - Current Liabilities

## Common Balance Sheet Issues

### Classification Challenges
- Current vs. non-current distinctions
- Operating vs. financial items
- Tangible vs. intangible assets

### Valuation Complexities
- Historical cost vs. fair value
- Impairment testing requirements
- Depreciation method choices

### Off-Balance Sheet Items
- Operating leases (pre-ASC 842)
- Contingent liabilities
- Special purpose entities

## Audit Considerations

### Key Assertions Tested
- **Existence**: Assets/liabilities actually exist
- **Completeness**: All items are recorded
- **Valuation**: Appropriate amounts used
- **Rights/Obligations**: Entity owns/owes items
- **Presentation**: Proper classification and disclosure

### Common Audit Procedures
- Physical inventory counts
- Accounts receivable confirmations
- Bank reconciliations
- Fixed asset inspections
- Debt agreement reviews

## International Differences (GAAP vs. IFRS)

| Aspect | US GAAP | IFRS |
|--------|---------|------|
| Asset Revaluation | Historical cost only | Revaluation to fair value allowed |
| Inventory Costing | LIFO permitted | LIFO prohibited |
| Development Costs | Expensed immediately | Capitalized when criteria met |
| Presentation Format | No prescribed format | Current/non-current or liquidity order |

## Analytical Framework

### Three Key Questions
1. **What does the company own?** (Assets)
2. **What does it owe?** (Liabilities)
3. **What's left for owners?** (Equity)

### Red Flags to Watch
- Rapid growth in receivables vs. sales
- Increasing days sales outstanding
- Growing inventory levels
- Rising debt ratios
- Negative working capital
- Large off-balance sheet commitments

## Technology and Modern Practices

### Automation Impact
- ERP systems for real-time updates
- Automated journal entries
- Continuous close processes
- XBRL reporting requirements

### Emerging Issues
- Cryptocurrency holdings
- Digital asset valuation
- ESG reporting integration
- Climate risk disclosures

## Key Takeaways

1. **Balance sheet is a snapshot** at a specific point in time
2. **Every transaction affects at least two accounts** (double-entry)
3. **Accounting equation must always balance**
4. **Adjusting entries critical** for accrual accounting
5. **Classification matters** for analysis and ratios
6. **Historical cost dominates** but fair value increasing
7. **Off-balance sheet items** require careful review
8. **Working capital management** drives operational success
9. **Audit provides assurance** but not guarantee
10. **International convergence ongoing** but differences remain
