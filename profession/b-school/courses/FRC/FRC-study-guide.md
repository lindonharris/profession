## üéØ Core Accounting Frameworks

### 1. Fundamental Accounting Equation

**Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity**

Expanded:
**Assets = Liabilities + Contributed Capital + Retained Earnings**

Where Retained Earnings = Beginning RE + Net Income - Dividends

#### Double-Entry System Rules
| Account Type | Debit (Dr) | Credit (Cr) |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Assets | Increase | Decrease |
| Liabilities | Decrease | Increase |
| Equity | Decrease | Increase |
| Revenue | Decrease | Increase |
| Expenses | Increase | Decrease |

**Memory Aid**: "DEALER"
- **D**ebits: **E**xpenses, **A**ssets, **L**osses
- **E**verything **E**lse = **R**evenue (Credits)

### 2. Financial Statements Framework

#### Income Statement
```
Revenue
- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
= Gross Profit
- Operating Expenses (SG&A, R&D)
= Operating Income (EBIT)
- Interest Expense
= Income Before Tax
- Tax Expense
= Net Income
```

#### Balance Sheet Structure
```
ASSETS                          LIABILITIES & EQUITY
Current Assets:                 Current Liabilities:
- Cash                         - Accounts Payable
- Accounts Receivable          - Accrued Expenses
- Inventory                    - Current Portion of LT Debt
- Prepaid Expenses
                              Long-term Liabilities:
Non-current Assets:           - Long-term Debt
- PP&E (net)                  - Deferred Taxes
- Intangible Assets
- Goodwill                    Shareholders' Equity:
                              - Common Stock
                              - Additional Paid-in Capital
                              - Retained Earnings
                              - Treasury Stock
```

#### Cash Flow Statement (Indirect Method)
```
Operating Activities:
Net Income
+ Non-cash expenses (Depreciation, Amortization)
- Gains / + Losses on sales
+/- Changes in Working Capital:
  - Increase in AR (cash use)
  + Increase in AP (cash source)
  - Increase in Inventory (cash use)
= Cash from Operations

Investing Activities:
- Capital Expenditures
+ Proceeds from Asset Sales
- Acquisitions
= Cash from Investing

Financing Activities:
+ Debt Issuance
- Debt Repayment
+ Equity Issuance
- Dividends
- Share Buybacks
= Cash from Financing

Net Change in Cash = Operating + Investing + Financing
```

### 3. Revenue Recognition (ASC 606)

#### Five-Step Model
1. **Identify the contract** with customer
2. **Identify performance obligations** in the contract
3. **Determine transaction price**
4. **Allocate transaction price** to performance obligations
5. **Recognize revenue** when/as performance obligation satisfied

#### Key Principles
- **Point in Time**: When control transfers (most goods)
- **Over Time**: As performance occurs (services, construction)
- **Principal vs Agent**: Gross vs Net revenue reporting

### 4. Key Accounting Concepts

#### Matching Principle
- Match expenses with revenues they generate
- Drives accrual accounting
- Creates timing differences

#### Conservatism Principle
- Recognize losses immediately
- Recognize gains only when realized
- Lower of cost or market for inventory

#### Materiality
- Focus on items that affect decisions
- Quantitative (5% rule of thumb)
- Qualitative considerations

## üìä Financial Analysis Toolkit

### 1. DuPont Framework

**ROE = Net Margin √ó Asset Turnover √ó Equity Multiplier**

Expanded:
```
ROE = (Net Income/Sales) √ó (Sales/Assets) √ó (Assets/Equity)
```

#### Component Analysis
- **Profitability**: Net Margin
- **Efficiency**: Asset Turnover
- **Leverage**: Equity Multiplier

### 2. Key Financial Ratios

#### Liquidity Ratios
| Ratio | Formula | Benchmark | Interpretation |
|-------|---------|-----------|----------------|
| Current Ratio | Current Assets / Current Liabilities | > 1.0 | Ability to pay short-term obligations |
| Quick Ratio | (CA - Inventory) / CL | > 0.8 | Immediate liquidity |
| Cash Ratio | Cash / Current Liabilities | > 0.2 | Most conservative liquidity |

#### Profitability Ratios
| Ratio | Formula | What It Measures |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| Gross Margin | Gross Profit / Sales | Pricing power & efficiency |
| Operating Margin | EBIT / Sales | Operating efficiency |
| Net Margin | Net Income / Sales | Overall profitability |
| ROA | Net Income / Total Assets | Asset efficiency |
| ROE | Net Income / Equity | Return to shareholders |

#### Efficiency Ratios
| Ratio | Formula | Interpretation |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| Inventory Turnover | COGS / Average Inventory | How fast inventory sells |
| Days Inventory | 365 / Inventory Turnover | Days to sell inventory |
| Receivables Turnover | Sales / Average AR | Collection efficiency |
| Days Sales Outstanding | 365 / AR Turnover | Days to collect |
| Asset Turnover | Sales / Average Assets | Asset utilization |

#### Leverage Ratios
| Ratio | Formula | Risk Level |
|-------|---------|------------|
| Debt-to-Equity | Total Debt / Equity | < 1.0 = Conservative |
| Debt-to-Assets | Total Debt / Assets | < 0.5 = Safe |
| Interest Coverage | EBIT / Interest | > 3.0 = Comfortable |

### 3. Working Capital Analysis

**Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities**

#### Cash Conversion Cycle
```
CCC = Days Inventory Outstanding
    + Days Sales Outstanding
    - Days Payables Outstanding
```

Shorter cycle = Better cash management
