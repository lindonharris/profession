# Strategy Syllabus - RC Fall 2025

## Course Overview

### Purpose
Firms face unprecedented challenges: technological change, new business models, shifting customer preferences, and geopolitical changes. The RC Strategy course introduces you to the central strategic challenges facing CEOs and senior leaders.

### Core Definition
**Strategy**: An integrated set of choices that positions a firm in its industry so as to create and capture superior value over the long run.

### Three Central Components of Strategic Decision-Making
1. **Identifying the roots of competitive advantage**
2. **Evaluating the limits to such advantage**
3. **Making decisions that create and sustain performance advantages over time**

### The Strategist's Three Jobs

#### 1. Sizing Up the External Environment
- Understand the firm's environment in its entirety
- See how external factors interact to constrain or create opportunities
- Go beyond functional expertise to see the whole landscape

#### 2. Aligning Internal Choices for Competitive Advantage
- Configure all choices across every part of the firm
- Create a whole greater than the sum of its parts
- Integrate across functions (operations, marketing, HR, finance)

#### 3. Sustaining Advantage Over Time
- Manage long-term commitments and strategic moves
- Consider long-run performance amid changing circumstances
- Develop sense of short-run actions for long-run health
