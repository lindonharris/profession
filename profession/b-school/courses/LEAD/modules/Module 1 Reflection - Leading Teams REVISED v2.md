# Module 1 (Leading Teams) Reflection - v2

**Worst Team Experience & What Would Have Helped:**

My worst team had Erik Peterson problems—unclear roles, conflict avoidance, everyone assuming someone else was handling it. What actually went wrong was psychological safety. Nobody felt comfortable saying they didn't understand what was happening, so we all just protected our turf.

C&S showed me how team-based accountability forces you to address dysfunction immediately. Jackie Hu's dashboards made the problems visible. Can't hide behind ambiguity when everything's public.

**What I'm Taking Forward:**

I'm at HBS to learn how to lead organizations. That's the work—not analyzing them, actually running them. Which means learning to mediate between perspectives, humble myself in rooms full of people smarter than me, and say the hard thing when everyone's avoiding it.

Riley's teaching style is what I need. Well-prepared, funny as hell, deeply provocative. He makes you confront your own instincts instead of just nodding along.

Peterson failed because conflict avoidance became cancer. I default to collaboration, but this semester showed me that's a weakness without the discipline to address tension head-on.
