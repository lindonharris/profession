# Module 1 (Leading Teams) Reflection

**Worst Team Experience & What Would Have Helped:**

My worst team experience had classic Erik Peterson problems: unclear roles, conflict avoidance, everyone assuming someone else was handling critical issues. What actually went wrong was lack of psychological safetyâ€”people protected their turf instead of solving problems.

The C&S case showed how team-based accountability creates pressure to address issues immediately rather than letting them fester. If we'd implemented something like Jackie Hu's status dashboards, we couldn't have hidden behind ambiguity. The dysfunction would've been undeniable, forcing intervention.

**Aspect to Incorporate in My Leadership Philosophy:**

Managing up is as critical as managing down, and conflict avoidance is organizational cancer. Peterson's downfall was failing to force Jenkins into engagement and avoiding difficult conversations with Andrews and Cantor. I tend toward collaboration, but Peterson's case shows that becomes a weakness without discipline to address conflict directly. I want to create conditions for teams to self-organize while being willing to make hard calls when needed.
