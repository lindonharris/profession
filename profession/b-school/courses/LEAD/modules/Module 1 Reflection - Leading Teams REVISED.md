# Module 1 (Leading Teams) Reflection - Revised

**Worst Team Experience & What Would Have Helped:**

My worst team experience looked like Erik Peterson—unclear roles, conflict avoidance, everyone assuming someone else had it handled. But what actually broke us was that nobody felt safe saying they didn't know what was going on. We protected territory instead of solving problems.

Jackie Hu's dashboards from C&S would've made the dysfunction impossible to ignore. You can't hide behind ambiguity when the numbers are public.

**What I'm Taking Forward:**

I came to HBS to learn how to lead organizations, not just analyze them. That means getting comfortable with the messy parts—mediating perspectives, humbling myself in front of smarter colleagues, saying the hard thing when everyone's avoiding it.

James Riley's teaching style—well-prepared, funny, deeply provocative—forces you to confront your own instincts. Peterson's failure was conflict avoidance becoming organizational cancer. I lean toward collaboration, but this module showed that becomes weakness without discipline to address tension directly.

The work is creating conditions for self-organization while making hard calls when needed.
