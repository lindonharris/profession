## Class Discussion Notes

### My Participation
- **Times Spoken**: 2 (Day 1/First Class)
- **Cold Called**: No

### Manufacturing Strategy Issues
The class identified **"First time outsourcing (lack of experience) & Re-entry net device"** as compounding risk factors. This combination created a perfect storm—new manufacturing approach, international operations, and regulatory complexity—that demanded more experienced management than Peterson could provide. The **catheters** themselves represented highly specialized medical devices requiring precision manufacturing that amplified the consequences of any operational mistakes.

### Multi-Level Systems Analysis
The discussion revealed Peterson's challenges operated across multiple organizational levels:
- **Self Level**: Lack of managerial experience, personal conflicts with reporting lines
- **Team Level**: Communication issues across functions, culture lacking trust/respect
- **Project Level**: High visibility project on tight deadline
- **External Level**: KOLs needing negotiation to participate in trials
- **Cultural Level**: Lack of willingness to address conflicts

### Leadership Assessment Framework
**What Peterson did well:**
- Weekly alignment meetings (attempted structure)
- Established KPIs (measurement focus)
- Visited Costa Rica directly (hands-on problem solving)
- Collaborative approach (perhaps to a fault)

**What Peterson failed at:**
- Not delegating effectively
- Hasn't aligned priorities on team
- Dropped the ball with KOLs initially
- Extremely conflict avoidant
- Reactive instead of proactive leadership

**Core Theme**: Peterson had fundamental difficulty with personal relationships and interpersonal dynamics

### Strategic Action Planning (Class Recommendations)
The class developed specific recommendations for Peterson:
1. **Set clear priorities** - Stop trying to do everything
2. **Enlist upper management (Jenkins)** - Force upward engagement
3. **Increase transparency** - Make problems visible with data
4. **Assign clear roles** - Eliminate ambiguity in responsibilities
5. **Deliver proof of concept** - Show quick wins to build credibility
6. **Re-identify priorities with Jenkins** - Align on what matters most
7. **Lean into Chip Knight's leadership & support** - Build strategic alliances

### Professor's Key Takeaways
- First-time managers often fail due to relationship management, not technical skills
- Conflict avoidance in high-stakes situations accelerates organizational dysfunction
- The transition from individual contributor to manager requires fundamental identity shift
- Organizations that don't support first-time managers in crisis situations share responsibility for failure

## Personal Reflections & Key Takeaways

### Synthesis of Learning

#### The Perfect Storm of First-Time Manager Failure
The class discussion crystallized how multiple risk factors—first-time outsourcing, re-entry medical device complexity, and international operations—created an impossible situation for an inexperienced manager. Peterson's case demonstrates that organizations often set up first-time managers to fail by placing them in high-complexity situations without adequate support structures.

#### The Relationship Management Paradox
Peterson's core weakness wasn't technical or strategic—it was interpersonal. His conflict avoidance and inability to build effective relationships created a vicious cycle: the more he avoided difficult conversations, the worse relationships became, leading to further avoidance. The class insight that he was "collaborative to a fault" reveals how strengths become weaknesses without situational awareness.

#### Systems-Level Dysfunction
The multi-level analysis from class discussion shows Peterson's problems weren't isolated to his performance but operated across self, team, project, and cultural dimensions. His reactive rather than proactive stance meant he was constantly responding to crises rather than preventing them. The lack of trust and respect in the team culture wasn't just context—it was partially his responsibility to address.

#### The KOL Failure as Microcosm
Dropping the ball with Key Opinion Leaders exemplified Peterson's broader pattern: focusing on operational details while missing strategic relationship priorities. This single failure cascaded through the organization, undermining his credibility precisely when he needed it most.

#### Structural vs. Personal Responsibility
1. **Organizational failures**: Dotted-line relationships, absent mentorship, inexperienced supervisor (Jenkins)
2. **Peterson's failures**: Conflict avoidance, poor delegation, lack of priority alignment, reactive management
3. **The intersection**: Even with structural problems, Peterson's personal limitations prevented him from succeeding where others (like Samantha Carter) managed to thrive

#### The Executive Visit as Point of No Return
Being excluded from conversations about his own organization wasn't just embarrassing—it represented complete loss of executive confidence. The class recommendations (enlisting Jenkins, increasing transparency, building alliances with Knight) came too late; Peterson had already lost the narrative.

#### Lessons for Future Leadership Transitions
- **Establish authority early**: First impressions in leadership roles are disproportionately important
- **Address conflicts immediately**: Conflict avoidance in leadership is organizational cancer
- **Manage upward aggressively**: Don't wait for your boss to engage—force the conversation
- **Build coalitions before crisis**: Relationships built under pressure rarely hold
- **Document everything**: Data-driven transparency protects against political maneuvering

### Applications to Future Situations
- Establish authority early through decisive action
- Don't wait for permission to lead - take initiative
- Build relationships before crisis hits
- Document problems and solutions systematically

### Questions for Further Research
- How do successful first-time managers navigate similar high-complexity situations?
- What organizational structures best support new leaders in crisis environments?
- How can companies better identify readiness for management roles beyond technical competence?
- What are the early warning signs of first-time manager derailment that organizations should monitor?
- How do cultural differences impact management effectiveness in international operations?

## The Executive Visit (Part C)

### Day 1: Warning Signs
- Peterson met executives with Knight to review revised April 15 launch date
- Evening at hotel bar: Peterson felt sidelined as executives discussed other matters
- Jenkins' breakfast comment: "You seem surprisingly unenthusiastic about the product launch"

### Day 2: The Assessment
- **Executives split up**: Jenkins/Dash used Peterson's office for calls while he waited outside
- **Informal interviews**: Executives walked around talking to staff without Peterson
- **Jenkins interrogates Wescott**: Hour-long session criticizing sales materials
- **Knight on Andrews**: "I don't like that guy – he has absolutely no idea what he's doing"
- **Exclusion pattern**: Lunch split (Knight with Peterson, others went separately)
- **Final meeting**: 4:30 PM closed-door session in Peterson's office without him

### The Demotion Decision
- **Dash delivers news**: Scott Green to take charge of launch, Peterson reports to Green
- **Rationale**: Peterson needs more experienced guidance
- **Team announcement**: Dash announces change to assembled managers
- **Peterson's reaction**: Stunned, humiliated, asks Knight about his future
- **Staff response**: Hanes and Burns express anger and shock

## Scott Green's Intervention (Part D)

### Organizational Changes
- **Manufacturing consultants**: Todd Jones brought in for Costa Rica
- **Sales/Marketing restructure**: Wescott put in charge of both functions
- **Personnel decisions**:
  - Fired Curt Andrews (after initial support)
  - Cancelled print advertisements
  - Reallocated marketing funds

### Peterson's Experience Under Green
- **Positive**: KOL problems resolved through Green's connections and negotiation skills
- **Negative**:
  - Green's harsh management style damaged morale
  - Focus on regulatory topics neglected other critical issues
  - Lost sense of teamwork and camaraderie
  - Peterson felt criticized despite improvements

### Escalating Tensions (May)
- **Wescott review**: Green denied promised raise Peterson had offered
- **Miczek compensation**: Green angry about unauthorized raise
- **Sales rep incident**: Peterson's delayed firing of dishonest employee criticized
- **Peterson's state**: 80-hour weeks, strained family life, growing exhaustion

## The Termination (Part E)

### June 3: Final Day
- **2:00 PM**: Green asks Peterson for walk in park
- **Stated reasons**:
  - Problems making effective organizational decisions
  - Inappropriate salary offers (Miczek, Wescott)
  - Failure to fire dishonest sales rep immediately
  - Insufficient KOL negotiations
- **SciMat's next step**: Bringing experienced GM from cardiovascular unit
- **Peterson's exit**: Given one hour to clear desk and leave

## Richard Jenkins' Perspective (Part F)

### Initial Hiring Rationale
- Impressed by Peterson's credentials and intelligence
- Only concern: "somewhat low-key personal style"
- Best available solution when VP-PVD resigned
- Expected Hardy's oversight and orientation to provide support

### Systemic Failures Acknowledged
- Hardy "not a good choice" for mentoring role
- Jenkins too busy with vacant VP-PVD position
- Lack of direction from Los Angeles headquarters
- Peterson inherited difficult situation with insufficient support

### Jenkins' Assessment of Core Issues
- **Peterson's failures**:
  - Inability to provide detailed direction
  - Trying to run startup like established organization
  - Overwhelmed, not in command of details
  - Lack of enthusiasm and defensive attitude

### Comparison to Success Story
- **Samantha Carter**: MBA with similar background who succeeded
  - Handled worse problems effectively
  - Maintained infectious enthusiasm under stress
  - Stayed immersed in details while keeping big picture
  - Assertive and motivating to team

### Jenkins' Reflection
- Challenge: "knowing how to select young managers with such characteristics"
- Need to "develop them further within the company"
- Acknowledgment of partial SciMat responsibility for situation
