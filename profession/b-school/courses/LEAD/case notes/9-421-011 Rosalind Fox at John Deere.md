## Central Problem/Decision

### The Question
> What should Fox do to enhance employee engagement at Des Moines Works without sacrificing the factory's record financial performance?

### Constraints
1. **Union Environment**: 1,000 of 1,600 workers unionized (UAW Local 450, IAM Local 254)
2. **Pay Concerns**: Wages competitive but employees dissatisfied; incentive pay varies across teams
3. **Complex Reporting Structure**: Three product line directors as bosses creates competing demands
4. **Perceived Absence**: Leaders seen as "out of touch" despite financial success
5. **Identity Dynamics**: Fox is first woman and first Black leader; faces additional scrutiny
6. **Factory Complexity**: 17 buildings, 3.5M sq ft, 4 product lines under one roof
7. **Union Contract**: Six-year contract up for renegotiation in 2021

### Success Metrics
- Improve engagement scores while maintaining/improving financial performance
- Bridge perceived gap between leadership and factory floor workers
- Address pay satisfaction concerns within existing structure
- Build trust with union leadership and workforce
- Maintain record profitability trajectory

## Analysis

### Strengths
- **Record Financial Performance**: Best year in factory history (2019)
- **Strong Leadership Team**: Most diverse in Deere manufacturing; high trust and alignment
- **Fox's Leadership Style**: Democratic, approachable, servant leadership approach
- **Proven Track Record**: 80% engagement at previous factory (Turf Care)
- **Executive Support**: Senior leadership backing and visibility
- **Strategic Initiatives**: Four-pronged strategy (operational excellence, digital tech, engagement, AI)

### Weaknesses
- **Physical/Cultural Distance**: Leaders perceived as absent from factory floor despite efforts
- **Communication Gap**: Office visibility high, floor visibility low
- **Pay Structure Complexity**: Incentive pay variance creates perceived inequities
- **Union Acceptance**: Some resistance to Fox based on race, gender, non-farming background
- **Limited Mobility**: Few pathways for wage workers to advance to salaried positions
- **Survey Reliability**: Leadership questions whether engagement survey reflects reality given strong performance

### Opportunities
- **"Lunch with Roz" Program**: Monthly gatherings to build personal connections
- **Internship Program**: New pathways for wage workers to gain experience in other departments
- **Physical Changes**: Coffee/snack machines, refrigerators on shop floor
- **Safety Integration**: Moving Safety Analysts to factory floor for better connection
- **Union Meeting Invitations**: Open door for union leaders to attend management meetings
- **Quarterly All Hands**: Platform for transparency and communication

### Threats
- **Double Standard Perception**: Fox feels she must work harder than white male counterparts
- **Microaggression Risk**: Customers/stakeholders questioning her authority ("Where's your boss?")
- **Union Skepticism**: Last thing union leaders want is to be seen as "member of factory staff"
- **2021 Contract Negotiation**: Upcoming six-year contract could amplify tensions
- **Diverse Team Pressure**: "If we aren't performing, then the story will become, 'Well, see, that's why we can't have diverse teams'"
- **Economic Headwinds**: COVID-19 and trade tensions threaten future performance

## Discussion Questions
1. How has Fox navigated her career?
2. What should Fox do to enhance employee engagement at Des Moines Works?

## My Analysis & Recommendations

### Option 1: Intensive Floor Presence Campaign
**Pros**:
- Directly addresses "absent leadership" concern
- Builds personal relationships with wage workers
- Demonstrates commitment and accessibility
- Can identify issues firsthand

**Cons**:
- Time-intensive; pulls Fox from strategic work
- May be seen as performative if not sustained
- Doesn't address pay concerns
- Limited impact if systemic issues remain

### Option 2: Compensation Structure Transparency Initiative
**Pros**:
- Tackles largest engagement driver (pay dissatisfaction)
- Education about benefits value vs. market
- Creates clear advancement pathways
- Addresses perceived inequities in incentive pay

**Cons**:
- May reveal actual inequities requiring costly fixes
- Union contract limits immediate changes (2021 renegotiation)
- Could backfire if workers feel "explained at" rather than heard
- Doesn't fully address leadership accessibility

### Option 3: Shared Governance Model with Union Leadership
**Pros**:
- Treats union leaders as true partners in factory success
- Leverages union communication channels to reach workers
- Demonstrates trust and respect
- Creates aligned incentives for engagement and performance

**Cons**:
- Union leaders may resist appearing too close to management
- Could complicate decision-making processes
- Requires culture shift on both sides
- May face resistance from other Deere factories

### Recommended Action
> Implement a **Three-Tier Engagement Strategy**: (1) Systematic Leadership Presence with weekly "office hours" on factory floor and rotation of management team through production areas; (2) Compensation Education Campaign with union partnership explaining total compensation value and creating transparent advancement pathways; (3) Shared Metrics Dashboard giving workers real-time visibility into factory performance metrics that drive their incentive pay.

### Implementation Plan
1. **Immediate (Q1 2020)**:
   - Launch weekly "Fox on the Floor" office hours in different buildings
   - Partner with union leadership to co-design compensation education program
   - Deploy digital dashboards showing team performance and incentive drivers

2. **Short-Term (Q2 2020)**:
   - Expand internship program to 20 wage workers per quarter
   - Create "Factory Ambassador" program rotating wage workers through management meetings
   - Implement recognition program for teams showing engagement + performance

3. **Medium-Term (Q3-Q4 2020)**:
   - Prepare for 2021 union contract negotiations with joint labor-management committee
   - Conduct focus groups to validate engagement survey results
   - Launch pilot of "self-managed teams" in one product line

4. **Long-Term (2021)**:
   - Integrate engagement metrics into leadership scorecards
   - Expand successful initiatives to other Deere factories
   - Document case study for company-wide diversity and inclusion efforts

## Personal Reflections & Key Takeaways

### Synthesis of Learning
1. **Performance and engagement are not mutually exclusive but require intentional integration**: Record profitability doesn't automatically translate to employee satisfaction; leaders must actively bridge the gap.

2. **Authentic leadership requires vulnerability**: Fox's willingness to ask for help, admit what she doesn't know, and bring her "whole self" (including wearing natural hair) created stronger team bonds.

3. **First/only leadership carries unique burdens**: Fox's awareness that her diverse team's performance would be judged as evidence for/against diverse leadership created additional pressure that white male leaders don't face.

### Applications to Future Situations
- When taking on leadership of complex organizations, balance deep technical knowledge with strategic delegation
- Build relationships before crises hit; Fox's mentor relationship with Worthington was crucial to her success
- Use systematic engagement mechanisms (regular check-ins, office hours, shared meals) rather than relying on ad-hoc interactions
- Recognize that "being seen" is different from "being present" - intentional visibility on the floor matters

### Questions for Further Research
- How do other manufacturers balance engagement and performance in union environments?
- What are best practices for wage-to-salary advancement programs?
- How can leaders measure "true" engagement when survey results conflict with performance outcomes?
- What happened in the 2021 union contract negotiations?
- Did Fox's engagement initiatives succeed? Follow-up case?
