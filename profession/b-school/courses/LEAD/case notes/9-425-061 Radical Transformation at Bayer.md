# Radical Transformation at Bayer: Dynamic Shared Ownership

## Quick Facts
- **Case #**: 9-425-061
- **Course**: [[LEAD]]
- **Class #**: 8
- **Date Read**: 2025-10-05
- **Industry**: Life Sciences / Pharmaceuticals & Crop Science
- **Geography**: Global (Germany headquarters)

## Executive Summary
In January 2025, Bayer CEO Bill Anderson faces a critical inflection point after rolling out the first phase of "dynamic shared ownership" (DSO), a radical operating model where employees self-organize into cross-functional teams of 6-12 people working in 90-day cycles with minimal hierarchy. Despite being on track for €2B in annual cost savings by 2026, Bayer's share price has declined 80% since the disastrous 2018 Monsanto acquisition, the company carries €32.6B in net debt against €19.4B market value, and faces ongoing Roundup litigation. Anderson must determine if eliminating bureaucracy through DSO can accelerate innovation and revenue growth—or if this risks losing institutional knowledge and discouraging junior leaders who measure careers through traditional promotions.

## Case Context

### Company Background

**Bayer AG:**
- Founded 1863 in Germany as dye-making company
- 160-year-old life sciences company
- Famous inventions: Aspirin (1899)
- **2024 Scale**: 100,000 employees across 80 countries, €46.6B revenue
- Three business units (2016 restructuring):
  1. **Pharmaceuticals** (39% of revenue)
  2. **Crop Science** (48% of revenue)
  3. **Consumer Health** (13% of revenue)

**Leadership Transition:**
- **May 2022**: Werner Baumann retires after 35 years at Bayer
- **2023**: Bill Anderson becomes CEO
- **July 2023**: DSO operating model introduced

### Industry Landscape

**Pharmaceuticals:**
- Bayer ranked outside top-10 globally by revenue
- Competes with: Merck, AbbVie, Novartis, J&J
- Key products: Xarelto, Eylea (patents expiring → generic competition)
- Pipeline focus: Oncology (Nubeqa), cardiovascular (Verquvo, KERENDIA)
- Strong China growth but margin pressure from 2019 pricing policies

**Crop Science:**
- Global market leader following 2018 Monsanto acquisition (€57B cash deal)
- Competitors: Corteva, Syngenta (ChemChina), BASF, Nutrien
- 2024: 2% sales decline (decreased demand from Latin America, declining prices)

**Consumer Health:**
- 3rd largest OTC drug business globally (after Haleon, Kenvue)
- Organic sales growth in line with peers, but EBIT margin lags
- Products: Nutritionals, pain relief, allergy/cold, digestive health

### Timeline of Events
- **1863**: Bayer founded in Germany
- **1899**: Aspirin invented
- **2016**: Restructuring into three business units
- **2018**: Monsanto acquisition (€57B cash) - "one of the worst corporate deals in recent times" (WSJ)
- **2020**: €9.3B Roundup litigation settlement (one of largest in history)
- **May 2022**: Baumann retires, Anderson becomes CEO
- **2023**: Bayer's market value declined >60% post-Monsanto
- **July 2023**: DSO operating model introduced
- **2024**: 95% dividend cut, €6B set aside for pending litigation
- **January 2025**: First phase of DSO rollout complete, on track for €2B annual cost savings by 2026

## Key Protagonists
- **Bill Anderson**: CEO, Bayer AG (since 2023)
  - Background: Succeeded Werner Baumann
  - Key observation: "The system was no longer serving the people at Bayer, but people were serving the system"
  - Vision: "If we are successful, many more large companies, held back by the inefficiencies of modern management, will learn from us"
  - Key decisions: Introduce DSO, strengthen pharma pipeline, address debt/litigation, minimize bureaucracy

## Central Problem/Decision

### The Question
Can the "dynamic shared ownership" (DSO) operating model—featuring self-organizing teams of 6-12 employees working in 90-day cycles with repositioned managers—successfully transform Bayer and become the future of corporate management?

### Core Issues Bill Anderson Faces (from Assignment):
1. **Financial Crisis**:
   - Share price down 80% since Monsanto deal
   - €32.6B net debt vs. €19.4B market value
   - 95% dividend cut in 2024
   - €6B litigation reserves for Roundup lawsuits

2. **Operational Challenges**:
   - Excessive bureaucracy ("nobody's really in charge—the system is in charge")
   - Siloed approach across business units
   - Slow product launches
   - Slow dispute resolution
   - Lack of unified customer/partner voice

3. **Business Performance Issues**:
   - Declining pharma sales (patent expirations)
   - Crop science sales down 2%
   - Consumer health EBIT margin lags competitors
   - Investor pressure to separate businesses/sell consumer health

4. **Organizational Transformation Risks**:
   - Will DSO eliminate bureaucracy or eliminate institutional knowledge?
   - Will "fewer bosses" structure discourage junior leaders seeking traditional promotions?
   - Can self-organizing teams drive innovation and revenue growth?
   - Is radical debureaucratization the right approach?

### DSO Operating Model Features:
- **Self-organizing teams**: 6-12 people, cross-functional
- **90-day work cycles**: Teams work toward specific outcomes
- **Dynamic reshuffling**: Teams can reorganize as opportunities/challenges emerge
- **Manager repositioning**: Focus shifts to long-term strategy and guidance (not day-to-day control)
- **Target**: €2B annual cost savings by 2026

### Constraints
- Deep financial distress requiring immediate results
- Ongoing litigation consuming resources
- Investor skepticism and pressure for structural changes
- Cultural inertia from 160-year-old company
- Competitive pressure across all three business units

### Success Metrics
- €2B annual cost savings achievement (by 2026)
- Revenue acceleration and innovation speed
- Share price recovery
- Employee engagement and retention (especially junior leaders)
- Institutional knowledge preservation
- Long-term competitive positioning

## Analysis

### SWOT Analysis
