# Jackie Hu: Launching into Leadership

## Quick Facts
- **Case #**: 9-423-021
- **Course**: [[LEAD]]
- **Date Read**: 2025-09-10
- **Industry**: Fashion Retail/E-commerce
- **Geography**: United States (LA/Seattle)

## Executive Summary
> Jackie Hu, recently promoted to lead Project Rocket (migrating Nordstromrack.com onto Nordstrom.com platform), faces a crisis with less than 50 days to launch. Nine of fourteen workstreams show red/yellow status after initially appearing green. She must decide whether to advocate for delay, risking year-long postponement and reputation damage, or push forward with a potentially broken launch.

## Case Context

### Company Background
- **Nordstrom Rack**: Off-price division of Nordstrom, founded 1973
- **Digital Foundation**: 2011 acquisition of HauteLook (LA-based flash sale e-commerce)
- **Separate Operations**: Rack team in LA, Nordstrom HQ in Seattle
- **Project Rocket**: Platform integration initiative to unify technology stack

### Industry Landscape
- **Market Position**: Nordstrom (premium) vs Nordstrom Rack (off-price)
- **Customer Expectations**: Seamless omnichannel experience (web-to-store)
- **Competition**: Growing pressure from digital-native retailers
- **Technology Imperative**: Platform consolidation for efficiency and experience

### Timeline of Events
- Oct 2018: Hu joins Nordstrom Rack as Senior Product Manager
- Sept 2019: Hu leads annual planning without formal authority
- Nov 2019: Promoted to Manager (3 peers become direct reports)
- Dec 2020: Project Rocket kicks off under Alberto Martin
- Jan 2021: Martin leaves unexpectedly, Hu becomes Project Lead
- March 26, 2021: Dashboard shows 9/14 workstreams red/yellow
- May 10, 2021: Target launch date (critical for Memorial Day)
- July 2021: Anniversary Sale (cannot update during)

## Key Protagonists
- **Jackie Hu**: Senior Manager, Product Management
  - Background: Silicon Valley upbringing, parents at HP, USC business degree, Apple M&A, HBS MBA
  - Key decisions: Taking on annual planning without authority, managing former peers, leading Project Rocket
- **Alberto Martin**: Director of Product (departed Jan 2021)
- **Swarup Acharya**: VP of Product for Digital
- **Megan Kiester**: Senior VP of Technology
- **Olga Ehrhardt**: Senior Principal Technical Product Manager (Nordstrom side)

## Central Problem/Decision

### The Question
> With <50 days to launch and 9/14 workstreams showing red/yellow status, should Jackie advocate for delaying Project Rocket, push forward with current timeline, or escalate for emergency support?

### Constraints
1. May 10 deadline critical for Memorial Day weekend sales
2. Missing May means year delay (can't update during Anniversary Sale)
3. Engineering capacity already maxed out
4. Growing list of "fast follows" signaling scope creep
5. Hu's credibility as first-time leader at stake

### Success Metrics
- Launch by May 10 with core functionality
- <1% transaction error rate
- Successful Memorial Day sale execution
- Team retention >90% post-launch
- Maintain momentum for June 7 full rollout

## Analysis

### Strengths
- Hu's relationship-building skills ("velvet hammer")
- Strong technical integration team (Ehrhardt, engineering leads)
- C-suite attention and support available
- Clear business case for integration
- Hu's ability to "cut through noise" to root causes

### Weaknesses  
- First-time leader managing former peers
- "I tend to trust" leadership style vs need for verification
- Distributed teams (LA/Seattle) without in-person connection
- Cultural divide between Rack (startup) and Nordstrom (corporate)
- Lack of clear communication protocols for status reporting

### Opportunities
- Unified platform enables better customer experience
- Memorial Day and Anniversary Sales drive urgency
- Crisis creates "burning platform" for change
- Chance to prove leadership capability
- Executive visibility for career advancement

### Threats
- "Feeling green is not a plan" - false optimism in reporting
- Technical debt accumulating in "fast follows"
- Team burnout from aggressive timeline
- Brand damage if launch fails
- Loss of Rack's unique culture/identity

## Financial Analysis
| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Project Timeline | 5 months | Dec 2020 - May 2021 |
| Workstreams | 14 | ~20-30 people each |
| Total Team Size | ~300-400 | Distributed LA/Seattle |
| Days to Launch | <50 | As of March 26 |
| Status Distribution | 5 green, 4 yellow, 5 red | Deteriorating from 10 green prior week |
| Rollout Plan | 1% â†’ 100% | May 10 start, June 7 complete |
| Risk of Delay | 1 year | Can't update during Anniversary Sale |

## Discussion Questions
1. How should first-time leaders balance trust and verification when managing former peers?
2. When is it appropriate for a new leader to escalate for help versus solving problems independently?
3. What are the warning signs that a project is in trouble despite positive status reports?
4. How can organizations better support rapid leadership transitions during critical projects?

## My Analysis & Recommendations

### Option 1: Push Forward As-Is
**Pros**: Meet deadline, maintain momentum, avoid year-long delay
**Cons**: High failure risk, potential brand damage, team burnout, technical debt

### Option 2: Advocate for Delay
**Pros**: Time to fix issues properly, reduce risk, improve team morale
**Cons**: Miss Memorial Day and Anniversary sales, lose momentum, effectively 1-year delay

### Option 3: Escalate for Emergency Support
**Pros**: Additional resources, senior cover, maintain timeline with help
**Cons**: Admits inability to handle alone, reputation risk, may still fail

### Recommended Action
> Escalate immediately to C-suite for emergency support while maintaining May 10 launch with reduced scope. Present transparent dashboard showing true status, request tiger teams for red workstreams, and implement daily executive stand-ups.

### Implementation Plan
1. **24 hours**: Schedule emergency meeting with Kiester/Acharya with clear ask for resources
2. **48 hours**: Implement daily war room with workstream leads and C-suite sponsor
3. **Week 1**: Ruthlessly cut scope to absolute minimum viable product
4. **Weeks 2-7**: Daily accountability reviews with go/no-go checkpoints
5. **Post-launch**: Aggressive fast-follow schedule for deferred features

### Key Insights from Discussion

#### Leadership Assessment Framework
- **Jackie Hu's Profile**: High EQ (emotional intelligence) as primary strength
- **Strong relationships**: Foundation for navigating complex organizational dynamics
- **Ineffective role transition**: Gap between interpersonal strengths and execution
- **Lacking delegation skills**: Critical operational weakness undermining effectiveness

#### Crisis Response Analysis
- **Project Reality**: Went live 4 days post intended go-live date
- **Organizational Support**: "Super proactive team reset whereby teams cleared calendars for two days to attack reds"
- **Escalation Behavior**: Asked for help from org leadership when facing serious challenges
- **Key Insight**: Crisis revealed both leadership gaps and organizational support systems

### Alternative Perspectives
- Even leaders with strong emotional intelligence can struggle with tactical aspects of new responsibilities
- Technical competence and relationship skills insufficient without delegation capabilities
- Success requires balancing emotional intelligence with operational excellence

### Professor's Takeaways
- Systematic processes and delegation skills necessary for managing complex projects
- Trust-based leadership style needs verification mechanisms
- Well-intentioned leaders can struggle without proper frameworks and milestones 

## Personal Reflections & Key Takeaways

### Synthesis of Learning
1. **First-time leaders need different skills than individual contributors** - trust but verify
2. **Asking for help early is strength, not weakness** - appropriate escalation demonstrates judgment
3. **Cultural integration is harder than technical integration** in M&A/partnerships
4. **Action Plan Framework Learned**:
   - Increase prep time for complex transitions
   - Use prioritization frameworks systematically
   - Pre-frame deliverables with clear expectations
   - Advocate for common objectives across teams
   - Establish key milestones with verification points

### Applications to Future Situations
- When promoted to manage former peers, establish new relationship dynamics immediately
- Create transparent communication protocols for project status reporting
- Build coalition across cultural divides before launching major initiatives
- Implement structured approaches to team management, not just rely on relationships
- Balance high EQ with operational excellence and delegation capabilities

### Questions for Further Research
- How do successful companies handle peer-to-manager transitions?
- What are best practices for distributed team leadership?
- How can organizations maintain subculture identity during integration?
- What frameworks help high-EQ leaders develop delegation skills?
