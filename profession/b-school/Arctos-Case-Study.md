## Timeline

**

**Time segment**

**Solo — your lane**

**Joint — both co-authors**

Pre-MBA (now → Aug 2025)

• Draft a one-page **Case Concept**: teaching goal, key Arctos decisions, fit with
  sports-investing curriculum.• Collect only *public* Arctos artifacts (press releases, filings) to avoid release
  headaches later.

• 30-min alignment call: divide labor (you =narrative/data, partner =interviews/exhibits).• Send a heads-up email to Arctos GC requesting preliminary blessing for a future HBS case (no releases yet).

Semester 1 (Fall 2025)

• Email concept to 1–2 target professors by week 4; attend one office hour to hear their “make it teachable” feedback.• Build a two-page **chronology sheet** of Arctos
  milestones.

• Joint coffee with interested professor before Thanksgiving; agree on teaching angle and next steps.• Create shared interview guide; list 6–8 Arctos execs/LPs to approach after New Year.

Semester 2 (Spring 2026)

• Draft the IP pre-proposal (one page, citing deliverable = full field case + teaching note) for EC credit next term; submit in early Jan per IP policy. (Harvard Business School)

• Conduct 3–4 key interviews Feb-Mar (record & auto-transcribe).• Partner builds first cut of data exhibits; you synthesize quotes into a detailed outline (≤ 3 pages).

Summer 2026

• Block **two weekends**: convert outline + transcripts into 5-page narrative start
  (opening hook & dilemma).

• Monthly 45-min Zooms to swap drafts.• Secure *draft* company-release language from
  Arctos legal using HBS template so final signatures are fast later.

Semester 3 (Fall 2026)

• Treat Sept-Oct as an **8-week sprint** (Tuesday/Friday 3-hour blocks): expand to 12-15-page full
  case.• Draft teaching-note skeleton (learning objectives, discussion plan).

• Weekly edit with faculty advisor (counts toward IP credit).• Run a 5-student pilot discussion in November; gather timing & clarity feedback.

Semester 4 (Spring 2027)

• Revise case + complete teaching note.• Finalize HBS release packet; upload to Case Services by March.

• Co-teach a 20-minute slice in advisor’s elective (meets “class-tested” requirement).• Submit to HBS Publishing; email finished PDF to Arctos leadership for Keystone collateral.
