## The Five P's of HBS Classroom Culture

Be ready to open and discuss every case.

### 2. **Participate**
Participation = Engagement. Listening *and* contributing.

### 3. **Punctual**
Enable us to start and end on time.

### 4. **Present**
Be engaged (i.e., in the room and paying attention), every class, for the whole class, with electronics off.

### 5. **Professional**
Respect for each other and your faculty, for privacy, and for the important work we will do together.
