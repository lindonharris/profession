Admit Essentials
Edition #7
HBS is all about participant-centered learning and for the model to work, everyone needs to subscribe to an "all in, everybody in" mentality. When everyone prepares, everyone benefits. By joining this community, you are making a commitment not only to yourself but to your classmates to bring your best each and every day. – Jana*

In 1921, the first case study was published at HBS focused on The General Shoe Company. Back then, the case method was originally called the “problem” method of instruction. It was modeled after the case method of teaching law and the clinical method of teaching medicine. And for over 100 years now, the HBS Case Method has been at the heart of educating leaders who make a difference in the world whose ranks currently number over 90,000 alumni in 173 countries. 

What makes the HBS Case Method so powerful is the conversations that take place in the classroom. Lively debates and diverse perspectives coming from every seat in the room help shed light on the best path forward for the business "problem" at hand. Suffice it to say, the case method requires an "all in, everybody in" approach to achieve its ultimate impact. It relies on every person in the room to be fully engaged — not only preparing in advance, but also showing up and contributing to discussions. **
Your HBS experience will be shaped not just by the connections made inside of the classroom, but outside of it as well. As you get to know your classmates, you’ll find countless opportunities to socialize both on and off campus. Once you receive the academic calendar, we encourage you to plan your commitments, including group travel, around scheduled breaks so that you and your classmates can get the most out of this shared experience. The classroom remains at the heart of the HBS Learning Model, and being in class is an essential part of it. 
 
By truly immersing yourself in every discussion throughout your two years here, you will leave at the end of each class with new knowledge, insights, and relationships that will stay with you wherever you go. Key DeadlinesAPR
