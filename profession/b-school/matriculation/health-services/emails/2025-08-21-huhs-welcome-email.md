**Your PCP is Emily Roan, MD.**

If you wish to change your PCP, you may do so at any time by contacting Patient Registration at 617-495-5795 or registration@huhs.harvard.edu.

- Gastroenterology
- Primary/Urgent Care
- Neurology

The Student Health Fee provides coverage for health care services within HUHS; it is not an insurance policy.

- Vaccines (except flu)
- Laboratory services, including the on-site Quest Lab
- Obstetrics/Gynecology services at the on-site Mount Auburn OB-GYN practice

## Connecting with Your HUHS Care Team

Your PCP is part of a larger care team that includes a nurse practitioner, nurses, and health assistantsâ€”all committed to supporting your health. We encourage you to schedule an appointment and begin building a relationship with your team, especially if you have medical conditions we can help manage. Schedule an appointment with your PCP by calling 617-495-5711 or booking online (limited) via the Patient Portal.

There is no need to upload medical records prior to your initial appointment with your PCP. Please bring them with you and discuss them in person with your provider.

## Using the Patient Portal to Manage Your Care

In addition to scheduling appointments and viewing medical records, the HUHS Patient Portal allows you to:
- Connect with your providers or request a non-urgent appointment
- Access Specialty Services and request a referral
- Schedule an initial consult with Counseling and Mental Health Services (CAMHS)
- Update your profile, including chosen name and gender identity

[Visit the Patient Portal](https://patientportal.huhs.harvard.edu)

To ensure patient safety and continuity of care, your care team cannot accept automatic prescription renewal requests from an outside pharmacy. If you have an existing prescription that needs a refill, please call the clinic or send a secure message to your provider.

If you need medical care that requires prompt attention but is not life-threatening, Urgent Care can provide advice and treatment. Urgent Care is located on the Third Floor of the Smith Campus Center. Please call 617-495-5711 before arriving.

[More on Urgent Care at HUHS](https://huhs.harvard.edu/urgent-care)

Outside of business hours, call the After-Hours Nurse Advice Line at 617-495-5711 for non-emergency medical assistance.

A counselor is available 24/7 via the CAMHS Cares support line, 617-495-2042, for mental health concerns that are urgentâ€”but not an emergency.

Please [visit our website](https://huhs.harvard.edu) for the latest updates and information.

We look forward to caring for you, and hope that you have a healthy, productive, and exciting time at Harvard.

Sincerely,

Kathy G. Niknejad, MD
Chief Medical Officer
Harvard University Health Services
