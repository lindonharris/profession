## Question 1

**Prompt**: The mission of Harvard Business School is to "educate leaders who make a difference in the world." The beginning of your MBA education provides a fitting opportunity to consider the difference you aspire to make in the world. We can all make a difference in many different ways, at many levels, and on many different people—family, organization, community, and even a nation or the world. In what ways do you hope to make a difference in the world?

**Response**:

Before 2009, Jim Millstein served as a Managing Director and Global Co-Head of Corporate Restructuring at Lazard, following a longstanding tenure leading the restructuring practices at Cleary Gottlieb. During the Financial Crisis, Tim Geithner appointed Millstein to the role of Chief Restructuring Officer of the US Department of the Treasury, relying on his deep restructuring expertise to manage the government's interventions of AIG's $182 billion rescue and recapitalization, the restructuring of GM and GMAC, and other crisis-era financial institutions. Following his Treasury service, he founded Millstein & Co., an advisory business later acquired by Guggenheim Securities, where he currently sits as co-chairman.

I have long been fascinated by the dynamism of capital markets and the relative nascency of our macroeconomic models in fully explaining or managing them. With only a few centuries of economic scholarship—compared to millennia of study in the natural sciences—our institutions and society are still learning, often painfully, how to harness markets for collective stability and prosperity.

That tension is what excites me the most. Like Jim Millstein, I hope to apply market-leading expertise in financial services to the broader public benefit. My ambition is to spend decades proving myself in the market, developing the kind of expertise that commands credibility at the highest levels of finance. Over time, I want to bring that toolkit into public service, where the same skills that drive returns can strengthen institutions and serve the broader economy.

## Question 2

**Prompt**: What are the three or four leadership skills that you want to develop during your two years at HBS? What commitments will you make to yourself about how you will best use your time here?

**Response**:

The leadership skills I most want to develop at HBS are organizational management, executive communication, and strategy development and execution. Each is essential for me to build a career that earns the credibility and track record I aspire to have.

Organizational management will be tested daily through the case method and group projects. I want to leave HBS with a sharper ability to mobilize people, manage complexity, and deliver results under pressure. Executive communication will be critical to scaling influence. I want to learn how to distill complex financial and economic ideas into narratives that persuade stakeholders and shape institutional decision-making. Strategy development and execution will come from learning across countless case studies in multiple disciplines, as well as through independent projects and research that translate insight into action in both markets and policy.

To achieve these goals, I will protect deep-work time, maintain discipline in my routines, engage deeply with cases and discussions alongside my peers, and build close relationships with professors whose mentorship can advance my long-term vision.
