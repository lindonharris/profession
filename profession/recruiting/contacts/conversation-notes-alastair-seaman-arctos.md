### Recruiting Discussion

#### Market Context
- Current MBAs report market is extremely tough
- Necessary to be highly premeditated and seek pre-MBA experience demonstrating "re-commitment" to field

#### Current Activities
- Interviewing with a firm for open MBA role
- Blackstone Tac Opps checks boxes as ideal landing spot
- Connected with HBS alum at 26 North who offered intro to recruiter

#### John Watson Conversation Prep
- **Positioning**: Spent time on both sports and Keystone at Arctos
- **Key learning**: Competitive advantage in markets with high conviction and structural undersupply of capital
- **Themes approach**: Thinking through big themes/trends to inform investment decisions
- **Wholistic thinking**: Recognizing diminishing marginal returns to sports asset class as capital floods in
- **Appeal of Tac Opps**: Unconstrained, flexibility appeals after being asset class specific

#### Key Advice
- David Blitzer video on Tac Opps - Blackstone as thematic investor [get from Alastair]
- Question for John: "In world where you're unconstrained, how do you minimize distraction risk?"
- Focus on relationship-building first, make asks afterward
- Note: Alastair doesn't like Josh Harris - "ruthless and solely devoted to winning"
