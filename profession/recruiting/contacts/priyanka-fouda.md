## Timeline
### 2025-01-16 — Comprehensive 26 North Overview & Recruiting Strategy
- Summary:
  - **Contact Background**: Cameroonian and Indian heritage; Wellesley (Philosophy and Economics); Career: 2y Goldman → London EMEA PE → HBS → Summer at HF in Baltimore → 26 North; Key advice: "You're at a point in your career where you don't need to work for a brand, you need to work for a person"
  - **26 North Overview**:
    - Business Lines similar to Apollo Strategic: Flagship PE, Direct lending, Insurance
    - Founder Josh left Apollo recognizing massive consolidation in alternative asset management
    - LPs increasingly concentrating in assets, looking for space where firm is savagely searching for alpha performance
    - Leadership: Josh (largest majority owner of sports team), Mark Weinberg from Brookfield (PE), Airlifted Goldman direct lending business
  - **Private Equity Team Details**:
    - Differentiated relationship with McKinsey: Head of value creation John Garcia (formerly headed turnaround at McKinsey), McKinsey is now an LP in the fund
    - Focus sectors: Media/TMT, Industrials, Financial Services
    - Growth: Hiring at mid-level and MBA+5 level, target fund size $4-5 billion
    - Process: Move slowly (6-month timeline)
  - **Recruiting Insights**:
    - Looking for: Big focus on technical ability, heavy scrutiny on modeling and deal walkthroughs, will appreciate sports and commercial real estate experience
    - Case study components: Deal walkthrough, 3-statement model, investment thesis presentations, need all basics down
    - Culture: Very nepotistic (Priyanka's brother interned, HBS intern was relationship-based then hired FT)
    - MBA interns: Only one, special situation
  - **Action Items for Me**:
    1. Summer Internship Strategy: Try for summer internship to demonstrate interest; Consider unpaid/shadow opportunities (even Arctos GP strategy); Focus on opportunistic, asset-backed finance, and tac opps (PE focus); Invest decent portion of summer prepping and building target outreach list
    2. Ian Charles outreach: Express strong interest in 26N (upper MM buyout) and TO (special situations); Light ask: internship (even unpaid) this summer; Be super targeted within realm of possibility; Have tight pitch, make it easy for him to help; Ian is super connected with 26N team and ecosystem
    3. People to contact: **Nwokiae, TK** - VP Amsec, very generous with time, gave Priyanka prep materials; VP on 26N team who leads recruiting
  - **HBS Advice**: Can achieve anything at HBS (launching business, megafund, family business) but unlikely to happen if not premeditated; Having tight story is crucial; Timeline for recruiting is aggressive with fewer jobs; Be over-prepared, target firms that are good fit; Be thoughtful about firms that offer internships (e.g., KKR takes 3-4/year)
