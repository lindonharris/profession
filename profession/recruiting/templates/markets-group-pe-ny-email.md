# Private Equity New York Forum Student Rate Request

**To:** IR@marketsgroup.org
**Subject:** Student Registration Inquiry - 14th Private Equity New York Forum

Markets Group Team,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is LinDon Harris, and I'm writing to inquire about student pricing for the 14th Private Equity New York Forum on May 13, 2026 at Convene - Brookfield Place.

I'm currently a first-year MBA candidate at Harvard Business School and will be conducting private markets research during the program. I will be partnering with seasoned faculty to author white papers and/or an HBS case study on GP/LP relationships, strategic decision making among emerging managers, or risk-adjusted returns performance within alternatives. Attending the Private Equity New York Forum would provide invaluable insights for this research while advancing my professional development in the sector. Does Markets Group offer a complimentary or heavily discounted student rate—perhaps in the sub-$500 range—that would enable my attendance as a full-time student at this premier east coast gathering?

For further background on me, I am an investment professional with experience across asset classes and industries, including two years at Arctos Partners—recognized as the #2 Mid-Market Firm of the Year in North America by PEI—as well as experience in structured credit and asset-backed finance.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to and learning from the exceptional discourse at the Private Equity New York Forum.

Best regards,

LinDon Harris
