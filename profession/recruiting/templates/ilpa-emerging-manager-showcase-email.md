# ILPA Emerging Manager Showcase Student Rate Request

**To:** info@ilpa.org
**Subject:** Student Registration Inquiry - ILPA Emerging Manager Showcase 2025

ILPA Events Team,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is LinDon Harris, and I'm writing to inquire about student pricing for the ILPA Emerging Manager Showcase this November 4-6 in New York.

I'm currently a first-year MBA candidate at Harvard Business School and will be conducting private markets research during the program. I will be partnering with seasoned faculty to author white papers and/or an HBS case study on GP/LP relationships, strategic decision making among emerging managers, or risk-adjusted returns performance within alternatives. Attending the ILPA Emerging Manager Showcase would provide invaluable insights for this research while advancing my professional development in the sector. Does ILPA offer a complimentary or heavily discounted student rate—perhaps in the sub-$500 range—that would enable my attendance as a full-time student at this premier gathering?

For further background on me, I am an investment professional with experience across asset classes and industries, including two years at Arctos Partners—recognized as the #2 Mid-Market Firm of the Year in North America by PEI—as well as experience in structured credit and asset-backed finance. I have a particular interest in understanding how emerging managers build institutional LP relationships and navigate their first fundraises.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to and learning from the exceptional discourse at the ILPA Emerging Manager Showcase.

Best regards,

LinDon Harris
