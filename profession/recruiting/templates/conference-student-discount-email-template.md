## SuperReturn Private Credit North America - Student Rate Request

**To:** [Conference Registration Contact]
**Subject:** Student Rate Inquiry - SuperReturn Private Credit North America

SuperReturn Team,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is LinDon Harris, and I'm writing to inquire about student pricing for SuperReturn Private Credit North America this November 18-19 in New York.

I'm currently a first-year MBA candidate at Harvard Business School and will be conducting private markets research during the program. I will be partnering with seasoned faculty to author white papers and/or an HBS case study on GP/LP relationships, strategic decision making among emerging managers, or risk-adjusted returns performance within alternatives. Attending SuperReturn Private Credit would provide invaluable insights for this research while advancing my professional development in the sector. Does SuperReturn offer a complimentary or heavily discounted student rate—perhaps in the sub-$500 range—that would enable my attendance as a full-time student at this premier industry gathering?

For further background on me, I am an investment professional with experience across asset classes and industries, including two years at Arctos Partners—recognized as the #2 Mid-Market Firm of the Year in North America by PEI—as well as experience in structured credit and asset-backed finance.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to and learning from the exceptional discourse at SuperReturn Private Credit.

Best regards,

LinDon Harris
MBA Candidate, Class of 2026
