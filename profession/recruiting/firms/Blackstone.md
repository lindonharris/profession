John Watson
- 
Talking points to get across

- 
*One of two portfolio managers of $60M lease portfolio *

- 
*Responsible for critical deal negotiations and risk return optimization *

- 
*Further differentiate my capacities as a leader and investor*

- 
*Such that I would learn how to price risk across a broad continuum of business types, asset classes, and industries*

- 
*Willing to forego matriculation for the right opportunity*

**
- 
Ifeanyi works with John all things technology AI infrastructure

- 
What they're seeing today

- 
Spending less time on regular-way pref equity solutions

- 
Reputation for a place you call where you don't know what to do

- 
Highly bespoke, structured solutions for operating companies, sometimes partnering with other GPs

- 
Continually creating a new form of investments: Coreweave opportunity $7.5B... structured GPU financing... new type of dela

- 
Consider yourself a solutions architect

- 
Sponsored DPI trades as well

- 
Higher fixed return stuff isn't really there... regular media isn't really there

- 
Creative partner capital

- 
GP solutions is much more oriented toward financial sponsors... what he's seeing is much more operating

- 
AI innovation has precipitated a dramatic change in fund creation ecosystem

- 
Long term compute demand implicatoins of DeepSeek were essentially nothing... demand is extremely strong in the long term

- 
Some control investments in the Tac Opps portfolio, but primarily non control

- 
No guardrails around size and portfolio mix

- 
however nothing below $200M is worth time given scale of capital base

- 
Solving for downside protection and some kind of portoflio convexity... convexity as a function as a way to outperform using fixed income component of a trade as a floor for cash performance, in combination with upside opportunity in the form of warrants or other securities 

- 
Thinkabout performance as outcomes that look somewhere between PE and infrastructure investing 

- 
Hard to find opportunities without intermediary... just trying to avoid auction

- 
TO is one of the few places that does recruit senior associates from business school

- 
Sports media is really interesting... structured finance capacbilities are important with those discussionss... less time around the team side of the business, unlike arctos

- 
Stay in touch with me and Ifeanyi, get to know the team. reach back out once you start school and we can take things from there

- 
Would be potentially interested in someone of your experience with Arctos expertise

- 
bought into my thesis for being a structured equity/credit specialist... special situations investor long-term. one of the few teams that will recruit candidates out of business school into a senior associate role

Questions

- 
What distinguishes an opportunity suited for Blackstone Growth vs. Tactical Opportunities when it comes to minority investments? (e.g., Spanx as an example?)

- 
Given the bespoke nature of Tac Opps investments, how do you approach risk/return benchmarking for more unique opportunities in the portfolio?

- 
What common risk/return hurdles does the Tac Opps team use to evaluate new opportunities, given the diversity of assets in the portfolio? Are there any specific metrics that consistently define a strong fit?

- 
How does Tac Opps balance managing both control and non-control investments within a single portfolio? Are there unique governance, operational, or strategic challenges to doing so?

- 
Are there any structural or strategic limitations on Tac Opps' flexibility? What parameters constrain the team, if at all (e.g., deal size, geography, capital structuring)?

- 
How much clarity do you have early in diligence on whether an opportunity is a strong fit for Tac Opps? What factors signal a high probability of fit early vs. emerging later in diligence?

Ifeanyi discussion - 12/17
- 
Discussion Background

- 
Chris James (CJ) is global head (been the face of fundraising for a long time), Chaz leads US digital infrastructure (Coreweave, all software infra), Cassum leading EMEA (focus on FIG, insurance, etc)

- 
Ifeanyi wouldn't have this job without CJ... he is very involved in the Black ERG at Blackstone

- 
Work very closely with John Watson... Black senior leaders at the firm are great

- 
No neat sector splits in Tac Opps

- 
MDs have two or three verticals of focus

- 
Only deploying out of Fund IV currently: Digital Infra (AI infra) theme is large focus... deployed 5.4B in one year

- 
Fundraising for V mid-next year... target

- 
Don't do much hiring at the senior associate level

- 
Used to do MBA recruiting in the past

- 
John Watson focuses on sports and media

- 
Value creation vs financial engineering: very deal-dependent

- 
Spent a lot of time learning about media rights, licensing, preferred equity and convertibles

**
- 
**Portfolio Focus**: What sectors or types of companies does the firm prioritize?

- 
**Investment Process**: Can you walk me through the typical deal process and your role in it?

-

Ifeanyi discussion - 9/2
- 
Background: Nigeria -> UK -> Princeton -> Fell in love with investing at BLK -> Interned at GS sophomore summer -> wanted the broadest investing experience with best people + compelling investment philosophy

- 
Tac Opps is Blackstone's "catch-all" group: asset stripping, preferred equity, growth equity, weird credit stuff, music royalties, sports teams and leagues... no two deals are the same... get to play all across the capital structure

- 
**"Rapid fire questions" ->**

- 
How big is the group? 40 IPs in the US... half to 2/3s in London... then Australia and Asia team... very small SF team

- 
David Blitzer runs day-to-day... he'll be out at the end of 2025 (perhaps co-head with Chris James and someone else)

- 
What proportion "home-grown" vs. external hires? Most people are home-grown.. would MUCH rather internally promote than externally hire

- 
Generally speaking, there is a route for you to stay at the firm: analyst -> associate -> senior associate -> principal 

- 
If external, what firms / institutions do they typically come from? Tac Opps doesn't do any structured post-MBA hiring. The only recent MBA hire came through the military internship and the one before that was three years. If not that, it's hiring through relationships.

- 
Ifeanyi says the culture is "fantastic" and people are "kind"... II just took a two-week holiday

- 
Comparable strategies: Apollo Hybrid Value, Ares Fund, CVC

- 
Ifeanyi works very closely with John Watson - he has been a huge supporter of Ifeanyi's at the firm and runs the Black ERG internally
