## Strategic Notes

### Plan A Philosophy
Finding an "Arctos pre-Fund I close" opportunity - an emerging manager looking to take a risk on me because I'm taking a risk on them. Either a high performing emerging manager or a bespoke strategy within a larger fund where I can have meaningful impact.

### Plan B Reality
Megafund PE, especially buyout, is a grind even at VP level. Maybe 1 out of 10 VPs will be "pulled up" on path to partner. Firms procedurally hiring VPs on campus every year signal commensurate churn in middle management. However, these provide strong optionality and compensation.

### Key Insight
Don't let talent go to waste parked at a large firm that doesn't want to invest in long-term ownership. Don't need validation or to prove I can "do the work" - don't get blinded by that insecurity.
