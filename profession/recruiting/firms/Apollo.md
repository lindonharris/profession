Victoria Yeow 1/28/25 - 2/5/25 
- 
Alumni network is one of the biggest benefits going to HBS

- 
You're probably not going to get a lot of the hard skills that others need, but the soft skills are so

- 
Background

- 
Singapore -> Stanford UG -> 2y IB (tech) -> 2y PE (tech) -> HBS... two years spending a lot of time talking without a lot of information... getting comfortable with imperfect data and using it to make quick conclusions... HBS makes your comfortable in uncertainty... timeboxed the amount of time she spent in cases... two years of confidece speaking camp

- 
Advice

- 
Skim your cases, get the key facts and just respond to someone about the case... speak confidently and be convincing even when you're not fully confident yourself

- 
Everyone is extremely friendly... prime time to meet people and make friends and expand your network... everyone has an amazing story to tell

- 
Common project in your second year is to write a case with a professor

- 
One of her friends is on the PhD path right now

- 
HBS is a choose-your-own adventure... all the teachers are there because they want to teach

- 
For independent study, it's relaly easy... 80% of professors are interested in doing that with you

- 
Take all of the leadership classes you can!

- 
Class called authentic leadership development

- 
It's like group therapy... talk about path and how it influences the kind of leader you want to become

- 
Tom Delong... tell him Victoria Yeow said hello

- 
Victoria's career path

- 
Like's the variety and stimulation of PE investing...  enjoys structuring

- 
Apollo is a monster at structuring really creative deals.. you can make a contract say whatever you want... Apollo has led the world in creative structuring

- 
PE is not a huge area of growth for the firm... Apollo is primarily a credit business moving forward... and the firm focuses a lot on liquid credit which frequently has conflicts of interest with buyouts

- 
At a $25B fund, there are not that many interesting investment opportunities available to return the fund 

- 
Guidance on career

- 
Optimize for a really great learning opportunity and great brand name... Apollo is that which allows you to go where you want and do what you want

- 
Victoria recruited for both the hybrid value and buyout funds

- 
From there on, you can pick your 5-10 year role... don't feel compelled to lock yourself in too early

- 
Take the first job post-HBS as an additional stepping stone and launchpad

Michael Weston 1/28/2025
- 
BY Football

- 
Credit Suisse Sponsors group

- 
Oaktree in Special Situations in distressed for control PE

- 
HBS ->

- 
Apollo for about 3 years... value-oriented

**

Guidance
- 
HBS prohibits employers from trying to speak to students for the first month or two... give yourself

- 
Knew he wanted to be on the West coast and be an investor

- 
Always wanted to be in a value-oriented, distressed shop

- 
LA market doesn't have that many groups for that type of work... set his sights on Apollo very early... reached out to associates, then principals, partners, etc... pitched himself hard for the internship... went through interview process and landed internship that was like a mutual interview process over the summer

**

Apollo
- 
started as a PE firm, but has since grown into a huge financial platform with a number of different funds but also insurance platform and credit platform

- 
PE is now a smaller part of apollo, though it is still a highly profitable growth area

- 
Work with Hybrid Value

- 
They are not control-oriented... typically structured/preferred or debt + warrants

- 
Michael's group is regular-way private equity... sometimes they will do preferred investments... but hybrid value doesn't have the skillset to handle the operational details required. 

- 
some sourcing synergies between the groups

- 
structuring to buy down creation value, thinking about 

- 
Apollo X PE does internships for MBAs and also full-time hires 

- 
100 investors in this group.

- 
each associate class is 12-15 people... mostly out of banks... most years there are only 3-4 laterals or MBA hires

- 
Buyout and Hybrid Value processes begin November, December

- 
In advance, connect with a handful of people.. talk to as many people in the organization as possible

- 
Will connect me with Sabora and Victoria Yao.

- 
Hybrid Value is much smaller (30-40)

## Jamal Cherry - 1/20/2025- 

Apollo NYC 1 year, Apollo Houston 2 y

- 
Just promoted to principal July 2024

 

You’re doing great
- 
Started reaching out to alumni early of his matriculating year

- 
Big opportunity to give yourself a pre-MBA internship… I didn’t because I wasn’t ready

- 
Internship recruiting kicks off at the beginning of the school year

 

How he got apollo
- 
Reached out to an alum, cold email

- 
Random connections are useful

 

HBS
- 
Provides access to wall street prep, weekend sessions

- 
Leverage the folks who are a year, two years ahead of you

- 
Got a list of people from someone who was a year older that gave him a useful contact list

- 
HBS absolutely gets people’s attention

 

Apollo
- 
Generalist hybrid value focuses on downside protection

- 
Risk/reward arbitrage

- 
Growing segment that LPs like it

- 
12-15% return range with a bit of upside

- 
New hybrid value within the sustainability and infrastructure group

- 
3 or 4 pockets of capital with different mandates all focused on energy transition

- 
PE teams at apollo still invest in distressed debt when the cycle calls for it

- 
Scale

- 
Energy ecosystem is like a middle market fund given size of team and scale of capital but all the back-office resources of a megacap fund

- 
Number of value creation and capital markets teams across the firm

- 
In most situations, management teams get very excited about all the resources available

- 
Apollo has a reputation for paying the highest on the street, so JC doesn’t see a huge reason to think about doing something else

- 
Bonuses can be normalized for market volatility across strategies

- 
Product diversity allows for less risky talent management

- 
Still a ton of room to take more on if you show the aptitude and build that trust
