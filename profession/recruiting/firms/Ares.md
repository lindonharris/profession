**Retention and Turnover**: What is the retention rate like? Do most junior professionals stay for the long term, or is there a high turnover?

-
Miles does direct lending, which includes sports media and junior debt... 90% sponsor-backed companies... pref equity, structured equity... they do everything aside from control equity and public companies... very wide private credit mandate

-
Within credit, there is an alternative credit group with a very broad mandate in securitizations... not huge but fastest growing and best performing

-
There's also real estate, secondaries, private equity

-
Had a special sits group that was previously housed in private equity... now called credit opportunities... direct lending has most mandate overlap with credit opportunities... they are more willing to get into hairier situations... they have a higher risk higher return threshold... willing to do potentially control equity (loan-to-own) stuff but not entirely distressed debt... akin to Blackstone Tac Opps ie lender of last resort type stuff... extreme diligence... lending direct lending is more focused on performing loans... credit opportunities has down extremely well because they have a very targeted book, whereas direct lending is more diversified and doesn't take as much risk... credit opportunities is also willing to be patient and sit on the sidelines... has contact at credit opportunities that he will tap me into post-b school
