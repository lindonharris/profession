## Overview

This methodology combines hard data from PitchBook/Preqin with qualitative insights from industry research and insider conversations to identify firms where I can occupy meaningful "market share" of thought leadership and innovation.

**2. Fund Growth Trajectory**

- What is the firm's reputation for developing talent?

- How does the firm balance work/life? (anecdotal evidence from insiders)

### **Sponsorship & Career Development**

**Potential Sponsors**
- Who are the partners most likely to champion emerging talent?
- Which partners have a track record of mentoring associates to partnership?

## Application Process

1. **Screen:** Apply must-have criteria (#1, #4)
2. **Score:** Evaluate against Strong Signals and Operational Health
3. **Research:** Conduct qualitative deep-dive on passing firms
4. **Prioritize:** Rank firms based on combined quantitative + qualitative fit
5. **Engage:** Reach out to insiders for validation and sponsorship identification

## Notes

- This is a living methodology - update as I learn more through conversations and research
- Qualitative insights often override quantitative metrics (culture fit > fund size)
- Focus on mutual risk-taking and long-term sponsorship potential, not just brand name
