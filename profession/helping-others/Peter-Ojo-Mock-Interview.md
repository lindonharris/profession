## Interview Questions & Responses

### Career Trajectory & Leadership Development

**1. On page 4, you state your reason for leaving Sony is "to continue growing as a leader and manager" and wanting "to inspire others toward a shared goal beyond my company's need for steady profit and growth." Walk me through a specific moment at Sony where you felt constrained by the profit-focused environment. How would business school help you reconcile commercial success with purpose-driven leadership?**

*Response:* Talked about entertainment being a hits-driven business. Discussed giving up rights for anime content. Main issue was not understanding what the target audience would be, losing out on the upside of potentially having a billion-dollar franchise long term. Sony lost out by not appealing to niche audiences.

*Feedback:* Get to the point more quickly. SIGNPOST - give the answer succinctly then go layers deep. Should be looking at 60-90 seconds per answer; you averaged 2-3 minutes. But good answers overall.

**2. Your "Key Accomplishments" on page 4 mention the CFG (Manchester City) partnership and Hayate JV, but your "Most Significant Challenge" was "establishing presence as a builder of communities." Why wasn't building strategic partnerships your biggest challenge given you had no LA connections? What does this tell us about what matters most to you?**

*Response:* Answer was straightforward. Spoke about rebuilding circles of community in LA which was hard.

*Feedback:* Positive/virtue-signaling spin was missing.

**3. On page 5, you describe leaving JP Morgan because you "wanted to learn the strategic rationale behind acquisitions" and your job was "focused on debt financing and limited in scope." Now at Sony in Corporate Development for 2.5 years, what have you learned about M&A strategy that surprised you? What aspects of the work still feel limited?**

*Response:* Good bringing up internal red tape/political misalignments that hamstrung location-based entertainment capabilities vertical at Sony. Follow-up asked what you would do differently in a position of power to influence what you're concerned about. Ideas about incentive alignment were thoughtful and compelling.

*Feedback:* Don't wait for interviewer to ask the "so what" or what you would do about it. Proactively offer solutions.

### Family Influence & Values

**4. In Essay 1 (page 10), you write about your father doing "part-time untaxed work to grow his client base" while building his medical practice. That's a remarkably honest detail about your family's immigrant journey. How did witnessing the gray areas of entrepreneurship shape your understanding of business, especially given both parents are healthcare professionals?**

*Response:* Said "maybe I shouldn't admit this" then talked about fear. Talked about father taking out a large loan from the city to expand the facility, whereby the builders didn't build to code and eventually mired him in a lawsuit with the city. Talked about complexity that entrepreneurial pursuits brought to his family life. Very good tie-in for "why business school."

*Feedback:* The vulnerability and self-awareness are really valuable—lean into that.

---

**5. On page 3, you note you were "the first person in my family born in the U.S." and your home was "heavily influenced by Nigerian and British culture, and the southern U.S. culture." How will having navigated these three distinct cultural frameworks inform your contributions to the case method?**

*Response:* Fine answer. Talked about calling mom "mum." Talked about not holding one viewpoint on a certain matter, seeing different ways of life, etc.

*Feedback:* Signposting would have been more helpful here. Went too long on this answer—maybe 3 minutes when it should have been much less.

---

### Leadership Philosophy & Mentorship

**6. In Essay 2 (page 11), you state "My ultimate goal is to be superfluous. I lead by empowering others to the point they no longer need me." That's a powerful statement. Tell me about a time when someone you mentored actually didn't need you anymore—how did that feel, and did you struggle with letting go?**

*Response:* Spoke about making Jeremy's life easier by helping him become quick and efficient through good mentorship.

*Feedback:* Beware that interviewers will press on any contrarian perspectives or viewpoints, which the "superfluous" point could be considered.

---

**7. You mention on page 11 that you "mock interviewed" a freshman interested in real estate and "connected her with the hiring manager" for Artemis, and "today she works on sustainable housing in Nigeria." Five years later, does she still reach out to you? What's your ongoing responsibility to the people you mentor once they've succeeded?**

*Response:* Solid answer.

*Feedback:* This was an opportunity to "get in and get out," knowing that interviewers want to get through a lot.

### Academic Performance & Resilience

**8. On page 15 in "Additional Information," you explain that caring for your brother with Bipolar I Disorder and witnessing a resident's suicide attempt as an RA caused your GPA to suffer. Your transcript shows a 3.31 cumulative GPA with notable improvement in later semesters. How did you develop the emotional capacity to perform professionally at JP Morgan immediately after graduation while presumably still supporting your brother?**

*Response:* Asked about this experience and the emotional capacity needed to support others in the way that you did. Talked about Nigerian culture and lack of hands-on support and intervention. Talked about the importance of consistency and showing up for others. Talked about becoming more empathetic.

---

### Community Building & Identity

**9. Your most significant challenge at Sony (page 4) was being "east coast-bred" with "no connections at Sony or in LA," so you became "treasurer of the Black employee resource group." You manage a $50K budget for an ERG representing only 6% of Sony employees. How do you balance advocating for Black employees while not being pigeonholed as "the diversity person" in your corporate development role?**

*Response:* Talked about prioritizing doing good work and earning the respect of your peers, then communicating to colleagues what your values are. Talked about being clear about intentions and what is important to you. Talked about not shying away from these conversations.
