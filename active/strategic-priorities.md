**
### FRAMING FOR ACADEMIC PURSUITS

**
- 
First experience fully investing in academic pursuits a student

- 
Pattern-matching across industries to drive superior insights and strategic differentiation

- 
My trajectory: investment skill-building and experiential learning across roles --> targeted thesis-building, catalyzed by HBS resources and infrastructure

- 
What my projects communicate:

- 
Case says “I have proprietary, ground-floor insight.”

- 
Paper says “I can generalize that insight to wider markets.”

- 
Track-record & grades say “I execute with discipline.”

**
### RESOURCES
- 
HBS Independent Projects (IP) Best Practices

**
## Summer 2025

**
- 
**Professional goals: **

- 
Mar 24 – Secure aligned, part-time work ✅

- 
May 19 – Compound reputational leverage on **LinkedIn**: Admitted & committed: “Officially joining the Harvard Business School Class of 2027. First time I’ll invest full-time in academic discovery...” ✅

- 
"My decision to attend HBS is the latest in a line of asymmetric bets I've made in my own professional and personal development... couldn't be more grateful so the support of so many along this journey. In particular, I owe a debt of gratitude to ..."

- 
Jun 02 – Author a one-pager "Investment Story and Edge" that distinctly outlines my pedigree for special sits PE and HF, including a comprehensive deal journal and research agenda for HBS

- 
Jun 23 – Schedule two informational Zooms with HBS alumni at each of my top five target firms, securing intros by August 1st

- 
Jul 07 – Complete a 2-stock / 1-situation mini pitch deck and ask HF contacts for critique  

- 
**Academic goals:**

- 
IP1

- 
May 19 – Draft 1-page case concept & teaching objective, shortlisting three potential faculty sponsors

- 
Jun 02 – Secure "yes-in-principle" from Arctos GC (joint)

- 
Jun 16 – Build documents folder; sketch issue tree for case

- 
Aug 25 – Send faculty outreach emails

- 
IP2

- 
May 19 – Write down three possible research themes

- 
Jun 09 – Author three literature review memos/research prospectuses on three possible research topics

- 
Aug 25 – Send faculty outreach emails

- 
CFA

- 
Aug 25 – Pass CFA Level 2

- 
**Tips: **

- 
Professional

- 
Show professionals that you’re wrestling with questions (“Why does permanent capital trade at X discount?”) rather than listing activities. In networking emails, always lead with an insight or hypothesis, not a request.

- 
After an informational chat, send the contact a “reflection note” on what you learned and how it shapes your thesis. It positions you as a peer-thinker, not a supplicant.

- 
**Protections:**

- 
Protect two 3-hour, early-morning “deep work sessions” (maybe early a.m. Tue / Fri). Never surrender them—IP writing, data work, or deep reading only.

- 
Maintain a strict, 5-day workout regimen—essential for intellectual digestion, reflection, stress management, energy regulation, and self-esteem boosting.

- 
90-minute “velocity recovery” block every Sunday. 30 min reflection (WIRTW), 30 min planning, 30 min meditation or walk. Research shows structured recovery boosts working-memory scores—your Cat I secret weapon.

## Fall 2025 • Semester 1

**
- 
**Professional goals:** 

- 
Sep – Submit updated resume and deal journal to target firms

- 
Oct – Compound reputational leverage on **LinkedIn**: CONTINUE HERE

- 
Nov – Update "Investment Story and Edge" to add RC "Case Insight Memos" relating class content to targeted investment themes; share collateral with contacts to assess intellectual and practical resonance

- 
**Academic goals: **

- 
IP1

- 
Oct – Initiate conversations with shortlisted professors to probe fit (joint)

- 
Nov – Produce interview guide with 6–8 execs (joint) 

- 
IP2

- 
Oct – Select a single theme and assess data availability for the execution of the project; generate one-page concept note

- 
Oct – Initiate conversations with shortlisted professors to probe fit 

- 
**Tips:**

- 
Professional

- 
After an informational chat, send the contact a “reflection note” on what you learned and how it shapes your thesis. It positions you as a peer-thinker, not a supplicant.

- 
Write a 150-word distillation after every class. Turns each case into recall fodder before finals and primes you for Category I exam essays. Takes <10 min—small habit, big GPA delta.

- 
Academic

- 
10 × I, 20 × II = 1.33 GPA -> 95% likelihood to earn Baker distinction 

- 
Enlist professors in crusade to earn Baker Scholar recognition

- 
Instead of 30-minute office-hour slots, drop professors a single, well-scoped question by email (takes them < 5 min to answer). Return with an update the next week. It compounds goodwill with near-zero time costs.

- 
Show professionals that you’re wrestling with questions (“Why does permanent capital trade at X discount?”) rather than listing activities. In networking emails, always lead with an insight or hypothesis, not a request.

- 
Participation portfolio approach. Aim for two high-impact comments per class week. Track them in a spreadsheet (case, date, angle, outcome). Portfolio thinking avoids feast-or-famine comment weeks that jeopardize Cat I odds.

- 
**Protections:**

- 
Avoid club leadership. RC and EC grades are critical, and IPs already supply résumé substance.

- 
Protect two 3-hour, early-morning “deep work sessions” (maybe early a.m. Tue / Fri). Never surrender them—IP writing, data work, or deep reading only.

- 
Maintain a strict, 5-day workout regimen—essential for intellectual digestion, reflection, stress management, energy regulation, and self-esteem boosting.

- 
Block Tuesdays 15:30-17:00 and Friday lunch for coffees. Anything outside these windows cannibalizes case prep—non-negotiable if you want 1.33 GPA.

-
