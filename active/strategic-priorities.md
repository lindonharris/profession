## Core Philosophy

### Academic Investment Thesis
- **First full-time academic commitment** - First experience fully investing in academic pursuits as a student
- **Pattern-matching strategy** - Cross-industry insights to drive superior insights and strategic differentiation
- **Trajectory arc** - Investment skill-building and experiential learning across roles → targeted thesis-building, catalyzed by HBS resources and infrastructure

### What My Work Communicates
- **Arctos Case** - "I have proprietary, ground-floor insight"
- **Research Paper** - "I can generalize that insight to wider markets"
- **Track record & grades** - "I execute with discipline"

### Resources
- HBS Independent Projects (IP) Best Practices

## Strategic Pillars

### 1. Academic Excellence System

#### Performance Target
- **Formula**: 10×I, 20×II = 1.33 GPA → 95% likelihood Baker Scholar
- **Enlist professors** in crusade to earn Baker Scholar recognition
- **Category I secret weapon** - Structured recovery boosts working-memory scores

#### Daily Habits
- **150-word class distillation** - Turns each case into recall fodder before finals and primes you for Category I exam essays. Takes <10 min—small habit, big GPA delta
- **Participation portfolio** - Aim for two high-impact comments per class week. Track in spreadsheet (case, date, angle, outcome). Portfolio thinking avoids feast-or-famine comment weeks that jeopardize Cat I odds
- **Email over office hours** - Drop professors a single, well-scoped question by email (takes them <5 min to answer). Return with an update the next week. It compounds goodwill with near-zero time costs

### 2. Professional Positioning Strategy

#### Networking Philosophy
- **Lead with insights** - Show professionals that you're wrestling with questions ("Why does permanent capital trade at X discount?") rather than listing activities. In networking emails, always lead with an insight or hypothesis, not a request
- **Reflection notes** - After an informational chat, send the contact a "reflection note" on what you learned and how it shapes your thesis. It positions you as a peer-thinker, not a supplicant
- **Living collateral** - Continuously updated "Investment Story and Edge" document

#### Key Deliverables
- **Investment Story and Edge** - One-pager that distinctly outlines my pedigree for special sits PE and HF, including a comprehensive deal journal and research agenda for HBS
- **Deal Journal** - Comprehensive transaction history and pattern recognition
- **Case Insight Memos** - RC "Case Insight Memos" relating class content to targeted investment themes; share collateral with contacts to assess intellectual and practical resonance
- **90-second philosophy script** - Prepare 90-second "investment philosophy" script for partner interviews/final round interviews
- **Mini pitch deck** - 2-stock/1-situation mini pitch deck for HF contacts to critique

### 3. Independent Projects Architecture

#### IP1: Arctos Case Study
- **Objective**: Demonstrate proprietary ground-floor insight
- **Faculty sponsor collaboration** with joint execution
- **HBSP publication** as credential marker
- **Co-teaching** to establish thought leadership

#### IP2: Research Paper
- **Objective**: Prove ability to generalize insights to wider markets
- **Data-driven methodology** with feasibility checks
- **Pre-mortem planning** - "How This Could Fail" memos
- **Faculty sponsorship** for academic credibility

### 4. Time Protection Framework

#### Non-Negotiables
- **Deep work blocks** - Protect two 3-hour early-morning "deep work sessions" (maybe early a.m. Tue/Fri). Never surrender them—IP writing, data work, or deep reading only
- **5-day workout regimen** - Essential for intellectual digestion, reflection, stress management, energy regulation, and self-esteem boosting
- **Velocity recovery** - 90-minute "velocity recovery" block every Sunday. 30 min reflection (WIRTW), 30 min planning, 30 min meditation or walk. Research shows structured recovery boosts working-memory scores—your Cat I secret weapon

#### Boundaries
- **Coffee windows** - Block Tuesdays 15:30-17:00 and Friday lunch for coffees. Anything outside these windows cannibalizes case prep—non-negotiable if you want 1.33 GPA
- **Avoid club leadership** - RC and EC grades are critical, and IPs already supply résumé substance
- **Block calendar creep** - Anything outside windows cannibalizes case prep

### 5. Professional Certification Track

#### CFA Program
- **Level 2** - August 2025
- **Level 3** - August 2026
- **Integration** - Link CFA concepts to HBS coursework and investment themes

## Execution Methodology

### Pre-Mortem Framework
- Draft one-page "How This Could Fail" memo for each major initiative
- Identify: data gaps, legal releases, calendar creep
- Address the top risk up front; the rest usually fall away

### Alumni Engagement Model
- **2 informational Zooms** with HBS alumni at each of top five target firms, securing intros by August 1st
- **Reflection notes** after each conversation
- **Living document updates** based on feedback

### Writing Sprint Protocol
- **IP1**: Begin two-a-week three-hour writing sprints, which will last all semester during Fall 2026
- **IP2**: Begin 6-week writing sprint after IP1 HBSP submission
- **Protected time** - Never surrender deep work blocks
