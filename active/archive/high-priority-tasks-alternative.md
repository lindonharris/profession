# Alternative: Tasks Plugin Table Format

## ⚡ High Priority Tasks (Tasks Plugin)

```tasks
not done
description includes ⏫
sort by due
group by due
hide backlink
hide task count
```

This will auto-update but displays as a list rather than a table. The Tasks plugin doesn't natively support table output.
