<summary>Email Draft: Jordan/Phil McGloin</summary>

**Subject:** Reconnecting – Phil McGloin

Hi Jordan,

I just moved into Cambridge this past week and am getting settled in your hometown.

A few years back, I introduced you and a few others at the firm to Phil McGloin, who at the time was on the private equity team at Bain. Since then, Phil has continued his pursuit of sports investing and, for the past two years, has been a VP at Avenue Capital Group. He's been closely involved in building their sports investing effort alongside Marc Lasry.

Phil recently reached out to me looking to reconnect with you regarding potential opportunities at Arctos. Here is a quick bio on him below. I'd love to be able to reconnect him with you, but totally understand if you're swamped.

**Phil McGloin**
- Graduated from Vanderbilt '18, where he was a member of the varsity basketball team
- Worked for Anta Sports in China as an analyst/project manager before earning his Master's in Management Science at China's top university as a Schwarzman Scholar
- Spent 2 years at Bain & Company, including time with the private equity group
- For the past 2 years, has been a VP with the Avenue Sports Fund, working on deals such as Team USA SailGP, COSM, and Ipswich Town
