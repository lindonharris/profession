# Special Situations Benchmarking Project

Research project where I seek to index and better comprehend the unindexed: how do "special situations" funds and firms perform against benchmarked peers? Is there a structural advantage to category non-specificity or sector agnosticism with respect to capital allocation? Are there any standard benchmarks?

How do they perform on risk adjusted basis?

## Objectives
- Identify and catalog funds that pursue special situations strategies.
- Compare their performance to relevant hedge fund indices and market benchmarks.
- Evaluate risk-adjusted metrics (Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio) over multiple cycles.
- Determine whether sector agnosticism or a flexible mandate provides a persistent edge in capital allocation.

## Questions to Explore
- Are there consistent return patterns across special situations managers?
- How do these funds navigate sector concentration versus diversification?
- What standard benchmarks, if any, are used to measure their success?

## Potential Data Sources
- Fund investor letters and annual reports.
- Public filings, 13F data, and regulatory disclosures.
- Third-party databases such as Preqin or HFR.
