HBS Halloween Party - Private Event Inquiry (10/31/25, 200 guests)

Mémoire Boston Events Team,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is LinDon Harris, and I'm a first-year MBA student at Harvard Business School. I'm reaching out to inquire about hosting a private Halloween party at Mémoire Boston.

Event Details:
• Date: Friday, October 31, 2025
• Time: 10:00 PM - 2:00 AM
• Expected Attendance: ~200 guests (flexible based on your capacity)
• Event Type: Private Halloween party for HBS students and guests
• Entertainment: We have our own DJ

I would appreciate information on the following:
1. Availability for the date and time above
2. Pricing for a venue buyout or private event
3. Minimum spend requirements, if applicable
4. What's included (bar service, sound system access, security, etc.)
5. Any restrictions or requirements for private events

We're looking for a venue with great atmosphere and sound that can accommodate our group comfortably. Mémoire Boston seems like an excellent fit based on the referral of several students in our community who recently attended an event at your venue.

Please let me know your availability and pricing at your earliest convenience. I'm happy to schedule a call or visit to discuss further details.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

LinDon Harris
