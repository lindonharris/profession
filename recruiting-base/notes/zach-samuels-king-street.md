# Conversation Notes - Zach Samuels, King Street Capital

**Contact / Firm**: Zach Samuels / King Street Capital

## August 13, 2025

### Investment Decision Process
- Investment decisions are made **much faster** than traditional PE
- IC members are used to making decisions on a **daily basis**
- Global investment team meets daily and makes decisions
- When they find private opportunities, they can move **significantly faster** than PE-native competitors
- This speed is a **real competitive advantage**

### Market Competition Dynamics
- **Private credit** is the most competitive market segment right now given growth in that area
- **Special situations strategies** are much more idiosyncratic and less marketed
  - Therefore, less direct competition between firms
  - More proprietary deal flow and unique opportunities

### IC Materials & Process
- IC materials are much more **cogent, practical, and concentrated**
- Focused on actionable insights rather than lengthy presentations

### Culture & Working Environment
- Working hours are **intense and serious** - similar to Morgan Stanley experience
- Not as fast-paced as pod shops, but still intense environment
- Real estate team is more extraverted; some teams are more introverted
- **Cultural identity matters** significantly in hedge fund selection
- King Street has been an adjustment for Zach:
  - Came from a place that was "super nice, super collegial"
  - King Street is more **silo'd and sharp-elbowed**
  - More serious environment
  - It's an adjustment but people are **motivated**
- Founder is worth $4-5 billion and is **in the office every day**
- **Very competitive** environment

### Key Takeaways

- Speed of decision-making is a key differentiator vs. traditional PE
- King Street and credit-focused firms aren't as fast-paced as pod shops but still intense
- **Growth vs. Steady State**: King Street and other credit funds aren't in growth mode like major multi-strat funds (DE Shaw, Point72, etc.)
  - More steady state and compounding on interest
  - Peer set includes: Monarch, Baupost, Elliott, and similar credit-focused firms
- Culture varies significantly across hedge funds - important to assess fit
- King Street has a more intense, competitive culture than some peers
- Daily presence of successful founder creates motivated but high-pressure environment
