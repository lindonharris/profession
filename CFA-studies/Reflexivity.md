Reflexivity refers to the two-way feedback loop in which participants both interpret and influence a situation. This creates interference between their understanding (cognitive function) and their actions (participating function), making outcomes unpredictable and understanding imperfect. Reflexivity is essential for grasping situations involving thinking participants.
