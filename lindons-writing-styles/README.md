- **Reference guide** for AI assistance in writing tasks
- **Self-editing checklist** for maintaining voice consistency
- **Evolution tracker** for how writing style changes over time
- **Onboarding doc** for collaborators who need to match voice

## How to Use

### For AI Writing Assistance
When requesting AI to write something in your voice:
1. Reference the appropriate style guide (e.g., "Use my academic-writing-style")
2. Specify any deviations needed for the specific task
3. Provide 1-2 recent examples if available

### For Self-Editing
1. Draft your content naturally
2. Review against relevant style guide checklist
3. Edit for alignment with voice/tone/structure preferences
4. Note any new patterns or deviations in evolution log

### For Updating Guides
- Add new examples as you encounter strong writing
- Update patterns when you notice consistent changes
- Date all modifications to track evolution
- Cross-reference related guides when patterns overlap

**Current State**: Template created, awaiting content population
**Next Steps**:
1. Analyze existing writing samples (LEAD reflection, case notes, emails)
2. Extract patterns and populate `00-general-writing-style.md`
3. Create context-specific guides based on usage patterns
4. Build sample library for reference
